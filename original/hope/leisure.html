	 Major League Baseball attracted a large number of fans and afficiandos when it rewrote some of the rules to ensure game times and 'thrills'.  Some of them included the acceptance of metal bats in 2023, which increased home run lengths, the abolition of the designated hitter rule, and the introduction of female (2019) and Cyborg (2045) players into the leagues.
