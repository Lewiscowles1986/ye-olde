HERNDON, Va., May 21 /PRNewswire/ -- PSINet Inc. (Nasdaq-NNM: PSIX) today announced that it will provide Internet service, sales and customer support for Pippin@World, the new consumer information appliance introduced last week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo Conference by Apple Computer, Inc., and Bandai Digital Entertainment Corp., Los Angeles, a subsidiary of Bandai Co. Ltd., Tokyo.

<p>The Pippin@World, based on Apple Computer's PowerPC architecture, plays Macintosh-compatible Cyber CDs with numerous multimedia titles. The $599 package will provide complete Internet access, including World Wide Web and e-mail, to consumers who have typically avoided computers due to complexity or cost, according to William L. Schrader, chairman, president and chief executive officer of PSINet.

<p>"This is a seminal event in three highly innovative and competitive industries -- Internet, computing and entertainment," said Schrader. "Tens of millions of families can now explore the Internet's many new entertainment opportunities with affordable hardware, software and monthly service costs which are less than most cable TV fees."

<p>"Pippin@World offers the easiest-to-install, easiest-to-use interface yet developed," said Kurt Baumann, vice president of marketing, consumer services, for PSINet.  "The integration of Apple Pippin technology with Bandai's @World and PSINet's industry-standard Internet service has effectively solved the costly customer support issue for novice computer users."

<p>The agreement calls for PSINet to provide a variety of network-based services in support of Pippin@World customers in the United States. These services will include sales and delivery, unlimited high-speed Internet service and remote storage for e-mail, files, and web hosting.

<p>"PSINet's Internet service will be delivered over our network's industry-standard ISDN and analog modems and frame relay architecture," added Schrader.  "While PSINet currently can provide Internet access by a local call to approximately 70 percent of the U.S. population, we are committed to add 800-number access for families living outside PSINet service areas for a modest additional fee."

<p>Bandai anticipates expanding Pippin@World outside the U.S. in 1997, where PSINet Group subsidiaries already provide Internet access via a local call to 70 percent of Canada (PSINet Canada Ltd., Toronto); 80 percent of the United Kingdom (PSINet Ltd., Cambridge); 50 percent of Japan (PSINet Japan KK, Tokyo); 40 percent of the Republic of Korea (Hansol Telecom Co. Inc., Seoul); and 70 percent of Holland (World On Line, Inc., Amsterdam).  The new system may also integrate various Internet client and server software solutions offered by PSINet's InterCon Systems Corporation subsidiary.

<p>PSINet is a leading provider of Internet access, services and products to both organizations and individuals throughout the U.S. and abroad.  The Company's PSINet network offers access to the Internet from more than 320 points-of-presence (POPs) worldwide.  Internet access options range from high-speed modem dial-up and ISDN for telecommuters and small office LANs to dedicated high-speed circuits for corporate connectivity.  Network Computing Magazine recently named PSINet a winner of its Well-Connected Award as "Best Internet Access Provider."

<p>The company has its headquarters in Herndon, Va., with sales and service offices across the U.S.; Cambridge, England; Toronto; and Tokyo. Further product availability and pricing information can be obtained by calling 703-904-4100, through PSINet's Web site at <A HREF="http://www.psi.net">http://www.psi.net</A> or by sending an e-mail request to <A HREF="mailto:info@psi.com">info@psi.com</A>.
