<P>
	 Most of the technology in the twenty-first century came about during the world wars, when everyone was attempting to make breakthroughs in technological warfare.  During these massive research and development discoveries, the major advancements were a 'side-effect'.  Some of the major advancements came in the form of advanced spaceflight, cybernetic organisms (Cyborgs), and cloning.

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Cyborgs</H2>

<P>
	 Japanese scientists, in an attempt to create an android, or artificial lifeform, happend upon a perfect melding of human and machine in the form of the cybernetic organism, or Cyborg.
</P>

<P>
	 Cyborgs became a valuable commodity quickly, since the advent of this 'invention' came about a few years prior to World War IV.  The Pacific Community's economy boomed with the selling of millions of Cyborgs to the European and Atlantic Economic nations.

<P>
	 Cyborgs were 'grown' up in test tubes, and moments after birth, are outfitted with a CPU inserter into the brain, and muscular augmentation and/or replacement.  Cyborgs generally outlive most humans by about thirty to forty years.  The oldest living Cyborg is currently sixty-six years old.  Cyborgs have normal human names (first, middle, and last), as opposed to a model number and manufacturer ID.  They are all implanted with an indentification module, not unlike the IDchips being mandated by the EC for all it's citizens.  Prior to 2045, Cyborgs were slaves to the human race, serving as laborers and soldiers.  It wasn't until Cyborg civil rights had been established did that change.

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Cloning</H2>

	 Currently considered extremely experimental, cloning was used primarily by the medical profession to squelch the need for organ donors or organ replacements.  The practice increased to include limbs, and very soon, whole persons.

	 The cloning of a person is currently considered illegal, but the cloning of an animal is within the bounds of the law.  Because of this allowance, there are no endangered species of animal.

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Spaceflight</H2>

	 Before the perfection of the fusion reactor in 2076, all space vessels were powered by rockets and thrusters.  The Agamemnon class of destroyer currently employs the fusion reactor as it's primary source of power and propulsion.

	 All major space stations rely on multiple fusion reactors for the same purpose, sans propulsion.
