Some items are rare, or very expensive. In the case of food, these items would not be found in 'low class' eateries, cafeterias, etc, but could sometimes be found at very high prices in classier establishments. Food production is rather like today, save a greater emphasis on nutrition. Not necessarily 'health food' -- more of a concentration on delivering the nutrients that everyone needs to survive. A few examples follow -- of course, there are other such items; these only serve as examples...

Chocolate, cigarettes, coffee, wine, etc.:  These and other 'luxuries' are production-intensive. While processing and manufacturing these items is no problem, the land to grow the raw materials is in short supply. Terraforming is a long and arduous process; until an alchemist's trick can be found, most land on various colonies is used for the production of resources more essential for survival.

<P>
Meat, etc.:  Meat from large livestock, at least. Small animals, like rabbits, chickens, etc, are be easier to raise, and therefore their meat is a bit easier to come by. Most use protien-based meat substitutes in cooking, as they can be produced far easier.

Real dairy products:  Like meat, cream, butter, milk, and the like all require some sort of animal who must be fed and maintained, requiring other resources to be consumed. While it can be found, and purchased at great cost, artificial substitutes are by far the norm.

Antiques, printed books, pop culture memorabelia, and other original items from Earth (especially those that touch the dead planet's familiar cultural roots) are legitimate treasures to those willing to pay for them. Carried away to other worlds by families fleeing in the final days of the war, housed in private collections by those who can afford to find them, and sought after by those looking for an easy fortune...
