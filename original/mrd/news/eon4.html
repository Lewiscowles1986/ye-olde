<h2><CENTER> Apple Sponsors EON-4 Web Sci-Fi </h2></center><p>

Continuing to expand its Internet presence, Apple Computer, Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) is sponsoring the first quarter of a new science fiction episodic Web site, EON-4, presented by American Cybercast, The Digital Entertainment Network.

<p>The Web site, designed for science fiction enthusiasts, allows Internet users to track the daily transmissions between the fictional Project EON-4 Headquarters, based in Groom Lake, Nevada, and three space explorers launched through a Radio Based Nexus Navigator (RBNN) on November 1, 1995.  The explorers touched "someplace else" on May 15, 1996, and a large part of the Web site was opened to the public yesterday at <A HREF="http://www.eon4.com">http://www.eon4.com</A>. The result of a fully fledged mathematics-based message received on October 20, 1992, at Harwich Station, Greenwich, from a highly advanced civilization situated at a far distant location in the universe, Project EON-4 has remained under tight security and its existence has been denied by ranking officials.

<p>"The EON-4 episodic science fiction Web site is an ideal sponsorship vehicle for Apple," said Allen Olivo, Apple's director of worldwide advertising. "Research has shown that Macintosh users are highly Internet-savvy, and one of our corporate priorities is to make the Internet easily accessible, informative and entertaining for our customers."

<p>Project EON-4 Headquarters, located underground within the highly secured USAF premises at Groom Lake, Nevada, and charged with the safe launch, continuing safety and health-condition monitoring, and ultimate successful retrieval of the astronauts, is almost a city unto itself. The Headquarters is home to 1200 scientists, technicians, administrators, military representatives and support staff. Apple has provided the computers and related technology to ensure the success of Project EON-4.

<p>"The Apple sponsorship of the EON-4 Web site is of great benefit to American Cybercast and the Internet in general in that Apple's participation is allowing this story to be brought to the public in a meaningful way," said Sheri Herman, president of American Cybercast.

<p>The producer of EON-4, American Cybercast, launched the world's first episodic Web site, The Spot, on June 7, 1995 and the site became an overnight success around the globe. An audience of 30,000 to 35,000 people visit The Spot on a daily basis earning it the 1995 Webby Award for Cool Site of the Year.

<p>American Cybercast is a diversified entertainment company primarily engaged in the production, acquisition and distribution of original content for the Internet. The company is based in Marina del Rey, California.
