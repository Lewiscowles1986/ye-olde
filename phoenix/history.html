<H3><TT>[ The Age of War: 2000-2087 ]</TT></H3>

<P>The turn of the millennia marked humanity's descent into global war, with a conflict in the Middle East pulling the planet into strife. Though the war itself was over in a few short years, the battle lines had been drawn, and power blocs had formed. Over the next decades, smaller wars and regional conflicts marred the planet as technology pushed makind further into space. Even the farther reaches of the solar system, though, were not untouched by the conflict. Terrorist attacks and the like plagued civilian stations and colonies alike.</P>

<P>The final war of the age was, indeed, sparked in space as a hostile ship opened fire on and destroyed Tranquility Two, the second of an ill-fated series of station-cities. Though the conflict concluded in a mere week, the deaths of Tranquility's residents had far-reaching repercussions. Two of three major power blocs -- the Atlantic Aliance and the EEU -- were destabilized as their governments were overthrown. Europe, Austrailia, and the vast majority of the African continent, were thrown into anarchy as power systems crumbled.</P>

<P>In 2087, Humanity was re-united under the banner of the Earth Confederation. Formed by the remaining superpower, it encompassed the entire globe -- and ultimately, the entire solar system, with its far-flung colonies. Supported by the corporations that had preserved Earth's economy through the times of war, the new Confederation offered unity and peace -- or at least the promise of it -- to humanity's 20 billion souls.</P>


<H3><TT>[ Pax Terra, The Age of Unity: 2087-2097 ]</TT></H3>

<P>The decade following mankind's unification was one of great hope, and rebuilding -- the construction of Hope Station, orbiting the tenth planet of Vulcan, carried the intent of exploration and new beginnings. The EC's military refocused on exploration and the betterment of mankind, keeping the peace its secondary goal. But as the economy of Earth and her far-flung colonies slowly recovered from the ravages of war, humanity's differences would spider cracks through the foundations of peace...</P>


<H3><TT>[ The Great Unrest; The Great Awakening ]</TT></H3>

<P>A mere year after the completion and opening of Hope Station, the foundations of peace began to crumble. Civil unrest and corrupt leadership on the moon colony of Lunaport erupted in violence, and misguided attempts to quell uprisings fanend the embers of protest into the fire of a movement. The emergence of powerful factions long thought dead, and brutal terrorist attacks pummeled humanity's psyche. The only possible outcome, feared by mostand sought by a few, was civil war. Planet against planet, Earth against her children.</P>

<P>The bloody conflict, though, would soon pale in light of a startling discovery on planet vulcan -- alien artifacts, long buried beneath the mysterious planet's surface, belonged to an unknown alien race. Humanity, it seemed, was not alone in the universe... Within months, the inevitable was upon us: first contact with a race from beyond our star.</P>


<H3><TT>[ The Great War: 2098-2122 ]</TT></H3>

<P>Fate is an unkind master -- and all suffered greatly under its whims. The first contact was badly botched; a friendly gesture mistaken for a threatening move, an attack, and a quick and bloody massacre that left both humans and aliens dead. The tinder of emotion, on both sides, quickly roared to an inferno as retalation was met with reciprocation. For a quarter of a century, mankind and aliens fought a tragic war, no less bloody for its  meaninglessness.</P>

<P>The war's turning point came almost 12 years into the conflict, when alien forces attempted to attack and capture Hope Station I, orbiting the 10th planet, Vulcan. Hope Station was used as a trap, however; Admirals Andrews and MacEwen of the Earth Confederation's military were the only remaining individuals aboard. As the bulk of the alien's ground troops boarded Hope Station, the Admirals coordinated its self-destruction, sacrificing their own lives in order to blunt the advance.</P>

<P>In the aftermath of alien retreat, humanity has suffered greatly -- reduced from 20 billion strong to a mere 1 billion souls. Planet Earth has  been destroyed in retaliation -- turned into a literal star by an alien fission weapon. Planets closer to Sol are uninhabitable, and the Red Planet's Jericho Colony has been reduced to little more than a refugee camp in the aftermath of the bloody struggle.</P>


<H3><TT>[ The Rebuilding: 2122-2132 ]</TT></H3>

<P>The world has changed much in the years following the war -- Earth's destruction affected humanity in far deeper ways than the obvious loss of life and living space. An entire culture, centered around a single planet, was violently severed from the most tangible symbol of its history and shared calling.</P>

<P>The 'history' of Sol and humanity is a mixed one in the ten years following. Scattered to the four winds, scratching out new homes on distant asteroids, colonies and outposts, mankind has withdrawn from exploration like a child pulling a burned finger back from from the flame. In this age of rebirth for humanity, history is what we make it...</P>
