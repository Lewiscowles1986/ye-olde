<H1>Hope Station Introduction</H1>

<P>
	In the year 2090, when the people of Earth abandoned their ways of old, the newly-formed Earth Confederation was determined to prove to itself that it had evolved and stepped forward into a new era.  An era of space exploration.  The Hope project was envisioned as the gateway to the rest of the galaxy for mankind, serving as an ambassador for those wishing to seek the human race out.
</P>

<H2>Missions Objectives</H2>

<P>
	As with all Military project, Hope Station is charged with the defense of the Solar System, provision of aid to all Earth Confederation citizens, overseeing the mining operations on Vulcan, and serving as a base of operations for all ECAF activity for Sectors 010 and 011.
</P>

<H2>Design Lineage</H2>

<P>
	Hope Station is an offshoot of the Liberty Station design, which was an improvement upon the Freedom project, and in turn, the Tranquility Project.  However, with a capacity of one million people, Hope Station is the largest at twenty-five kilometers long and seven kilometers in width.  The length of the Hope project is placed at an ambitious twenty-five years without any major upgrades, which outlives Tranquility Three to Tranquility Seven, since the Tranquility project projects a station built at five year intervals.

<TABLE>

<TR>
	<TD><B>August 2090</B>:</TD>	<TD>The Hope Station project, designed by the Station Command team is approved and Vulcan is selected as the planet it shall orbit, making it the biggest station in the solar system.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><B>September 2090</B>:</TD>	<TD>ECSS Tokyo and the ECSS Agamemnon (formerly the PCSS Tokyo and PCSS Agamemnon) tow the massively huge external support frame for Hope Station into position.  One week later, four transports carrying materials and supplies arrives.  A transport run begins on a weekly basis.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><B>October 2090</B>:</TD>	<TD>The long rotator 'cuff' construction begins.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><B>February 2090</B>:</TD>	<TD>Rotator 'cuff' completed.  Outer hull contruction starts.  Primary and secondary computer cores are delivered by transport.  Secondary core sent back because of major defect upon testing.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><B>March 2090</B>:</TD>	<TD>New secondary computer core arrives from Earth with the trietary computer core.  Both pass inital defect testing.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><B>May 2090</B>:</TD>	<TD>Outer hull and rotator treads completed.  Interior construction begins.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><B>February 2095</B>:</TD>	<TD>All interior construction and docking level construction is completed.  ConfedCommand orders mandatory six month furlough for all construction personnel.  ECSS Agamemnon is ordered to patrol the vicinity.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><B>August 2095</B>:</TD>	<TD>Workers report back to Hope Station, and superficial construction begins.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><B>December 2095</B>:</TD>	<TD>During testing of the rotator cuff, a stray unmarked vessel incurs on Vulcan space and the ECSS Agamemnon warns off the stray vessel.  After repeated warnings, the Agamemnon fires a warning shot, and the invading vessel leaves the area.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><B>January 2096</B>:</TD>	<TD>Hope Station is completed, Vice Admiral Hierhito Masaki is placed in command.  Military personnel are allowed aboard the station at this time, and the fusion reactors are started for the first time since construction.  The large external support frame is jettisoned, and the rotating sections appear to be functioning correctly to sustain gravity.</TD>

</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><B>April 2096</B>:</TD>	<TD>The first civilian transport is allowed clearance to Hope Station, fifty thousand residents are offloaded.  Civilians continue to arrive at Hope Station every week, fifty thousand at a time.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><B>May 2096</B>:</TD>	<TD>ECSS Asimov, the latest class three starship of the line arrives at Hope Station.</TD>

</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><B>August 2096</B>:</TD>	<TD>Two replacement patrol vessels arrive at Hope Station.  Second exploration team sent to Pandora, evidence of precious metals are found, and plans for a mining operation are made.
