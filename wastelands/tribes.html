						The Strongmen tribe controls Seattle under the guidance of The Leader, a mysterious individual whose face has never been seen. The Strongmen claim that the Leader is an immortal survivor of the Great Death, and they receive much 'old tech' from the Leader. The Strongmen hunt the Seers, at the Leader's command. Seattle's ruins are governed by the Strongmen; This superstitious tribe's command of technology places them squarely at the top of the hill. [See '<a href="technology.html">technology</a>']</p>
						<p>They use guns occasionally, and have access to crude medicines and other technological relics of the old world. Understandably, many who live in Seattle hope to join them -- a mother often ensures her child's survival by giving it to the tribe. The Strongmen have even been known to use electricity to power spotlights during searches, and they employ many in Seattle to find and collect firewood for their generators.</p>
						<p>Curiously, few of the Strongmen understand the devices they use. Only their leader, unseen by any outsiders, directs them. Many rumors say that he is an immortal survivor of the old world, using his knowledge of the old ways to bring great power to his tribe. Most of the Strongmen hold mystical beliefs about technology, and some worship the Leader.</p>
						<p>Unknown to all but the Strongmen's inner circle, the Leader is a computer, not a man. [See 'WNews AI'] The Strongmen hunt down the Seer tribe at the Leader's command -- none understand the reasons behind its hatred for the mountain dwellers. [See 'WNews seers'] But without the Leader, their command of the city would be a memory and the valuable medicines it manufactures for them would vanish. Any outsiders may join the tribe, but disobeying orders from the Leader brings swift punishment, sometimes execution.</p>
						<p>The Strongmen are commanded by the Leader's chief, a man selected for his dedication and strength. The chief is often replaced by the Leader, and the previous chief becomes a normal member of the tribe. Although the chief can be challenged by another member of the tribe, the Strongmen's infighting rarely becomes that serious.</p>
						<p><img height="36" width="366" src="titles/seers.gif"><br>
						The Seers can communicate with each other over great distances with their thoughts. This ability comes from an experimental pre-war nanotech virus that has infected the tribe for decades. They live in the mountains to the east of Seattle's ruins. Because the city-dwellers believe strange rumors about the Seers, members of the tribe rarely reveal their identity when exploring the city.</p>
