<H2>Internal Communications</H2>

	Access panels throughout the station act as communications devices, with a simple verbal command, which will instantly redirect your voice to the location of the person you're attempting to contact.  Scribers and Terminals have built-in communications devices, which listen for a vocal prefix, such as, "Smith to Lieutenant Jones."

<H2>Personal Communications</H2>

	Personal communications devices, such as 'Commo's, 'Pagers', or the military standard-issue device, 'Nodes', usually come in a very tiny portable version, which respond to a touchpad to open up a link to the computer's communication system.  The same syntax is used as with the access panels.


<H2>External Communications</H2>

	Stations and ships rely on microwave transmitters to communicate with each other, an internal microwave antenna usually sits on the upper portion of the ship, or the cuff part of the station.

<H2>Communications Networks</H2>

	The main network for all military forces are the upper frequency bandwidth, while public communications devices use a specific bandwidth of frequencies below that.  The stations and ships act as relay satellites for messages, as do all the perimeter outposts.
