				<P><TT>i remember sitting around her kitchen table, at the extravagantly
				late hour of 9:00. I could sit at the table and listen as she
				and the other relatives talked and drank &quot;spootnicky&quot; -- alcohol
				of some kind; I don't know what the name was, but that's how i
				pronounced it. I could crunch away on my planters cheese puffs,
				and she even LISTENED when my opinionated, 7-year old voice piped
				in and added its two bits to the discussion.</TT></P>
				<P><TT>I was her last grandchild, the baby that she could pamper with
				open favoritism. toys, gifts, snacks, attention... I truly was
				spoiled by her. But what I treasured most, even then, of all the
				things I received, was her attention. Her smile, her playing War
				(the card game, not the military conflict) with me at the kitchen
				table over 7-up (for me) and liquor of some sort (for her). Both
				of us had shot glasses -- I thought that they were ever-so adult
				and sophisticated. When I was at her house, I would want nothing
				else to drink my soda pop in.</TT></P>
				<P><TT>we would talk while we played cards, pretending to be high-society
				elite, discussing diamond mines, the stock market, the economy.
				I would take one of her cut glassware cups from the shelf and
				say it was made of diamonds, and she would make wide eyes and
				say, &quot;Oh, my!&quot;</TT></P>
				<P><TT>I don't know what would happen if she were alive now. If I would
				still be able to touch hearts with her... I think I would; she
				cared about ME, I believe, and our relationship would have grown
				with the years. I don't know, though... I would be a different
				person than I am now. I don't know who that person would be.</TT></P></TD>
