Though the war itself was over in a few short years, the		battle lines had been drawn, and power blocs had formed. Over		the next decades, smaller wars and regional conflicts marred the		planet as technology pushed makind further into space. Even the		farther reaches of the solar system, though, were not untouched		by the conflict. Terrorist attacks plagued civilian stations and		colonies alike.</P>		<P><A NAME="eeu"></A>The final war of the age was, indeed, sparked in space as a hostile		ship opened fire on and destroyed Tranquility Two, the second		of an ill-fated series of station-cities. Though the conflict		concluded in a mere week, the deaths of Tranquility's residents		had far-reaching repercussions. Two of three major power blocs		-- the Atlantic Aliance and the EEU -- were destabilized as their		governments were overthrown. Europe, Austrailia, and the vast		majority of the African continent, were thrown into anarchy as		power systems crumbled.</P>		<P><A NAME="ec"></A>In 2087, Humanity was re-united under the banner of the Earth		Confederation. Formed by the remaining superpower, it encompassed		the entire globe -- and ultimately, the entire solar system, with		its far-flung colonies. Supported by the corporations that had		preserved Earth's economy through the times of war, the new Confederation		offered unity and peace -- or at least the promise of it -- to		humanity's 20 billion souls.</P>		<P><A NAME="Anchor"></A>The decade following reunification brought much healing and rebuilding		for Earth's war-torn peoples. The construction of <A HREF="theme.html#hope_station" TARGET="_self">Hope Station</A> was completed in 2096, and the station soon became a symbol of		humanity's new journeys and explorations.</P>		<P>Conflict was far from gone, however -- the EEU's remnants still		dogged the Confederation, launching a number of suprise attacks		on Hope Station in late 2096. Attacks were repelled by the Station's		military personnel, and eventually waned. </P>		<P><A NAME="civilwar"></A>Greater threats were soon to come, and closer to humanity's home.		Corrupt leadership on the moon colony of Lunaport brought colony		near ruin, and an internal EarthConfed coup put President Peterson,		a power-hungry opportunist, in control. In 2097, the situation		exploded as Lunaport citizens took up arms to overthrow the colony's		Governor, and Peterson responded with force.</P>		<P>For months, battles raged between the 'Opressant' freedom fighters		on Luna, and the EC military. Opressant terrorists struck at other		targets, killing hundreds of thousands when a thermal bomb destroyed		Jupiter's Liberty Station. The turning point of the civil war		came in 2098, when an Opressant strike destroyed Peterson's motorcade		on Earth. EarthConfed's rightful president, Jacquelin Otonashi,		was restored to power and frantic negotiations yielded an uneasy		truce. <A HREF="#luna_independence" TARGET="_self">Lunaport's independence</A> was declared officially in late 2098.</P>		<P>As fragile peace settled on Earth and Luna, the discovery of <A HREF="theme.html#aliens" TARGET="_self">alien ruins</A> on the tenth planet in the solar system shocked the world, focusing		attention on <A HREF="theme.html#hope_station">Hope Station</A> and <A HREF="#vulcan" TARGET="_self" TARGET="_self">Vulcan</A> once again. Now, as humanity approaches the twenty-second century,		new discoveries -- and dangers -- await.</P>		<P><A NAME="lunaport"></A>&nbsp;</P>		<CENTER>			<P><IMG SRC="images/lunaport.gif" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ The Lunaport Autonimous Zone ]"></P>		</CENTER>		<P>First colonized in 2018 by the <A HREF="#eeu" TARGET="_self">European Econonomic Union</A>, Luna Colony was rechristened Lunaport in 2022. As decades passed		and other political blocs established their own growing colonies,		Lunaport's population eventually grew together, becoming a unique		entity rather than several extensions of Earthbound power blocs.		Eventually, the colony's residents numbered a billion strong,		and while occasional grumblings abbout independence wre heard,		Lunaport remained stable.</P>		<P>With the unification of Earth's government in 2090, Lunaport came		under the control of a single governor. Governor King's corrupt		rule, however, subtly eliminated the protections of good government		and allowed conditions to spiral downward for Lunaport's peoples.		By 2097, the situation reached the boiling point, and political		unrest exploded in armed revolt. An attempted overthrow of Governor		King, and the power-hungry actions of EarthConfed's President		Peterson, brought Earth and Lunaport to <A HREF="#civilwar" TARGET="_self">civil war</A>.</P>		<P><A NAME="luna_independence"></A>Two years later, with both King and Peterson dead and peace carefuly		restored, the colony exists as the Lunaport Autonimous Zone, conducting		its affairs separately from the EC. Under the leadership of Carter		Nunez, whose guidance pulled the moon's freedom movement from		the brink of self-destrution, Lunaport is re-entering the world		on its own terms. Eager to participate in the <A HREF="theme.html#aliens">discoveries</A> on <A HREF="#vulcan" TARGET="_self" TARGET="_self">Vulcan</A>, but unwilling to relinquish much of its new independence, Lunaport		faces challenges and choices in the years ahead.</P>		<P><A NAME="vulcan"></A>&nbsp;</P>		<CENTER>			<P><IMG SRC="images/vulcan.gif" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ Planet Vulcan ]"></P>		</CENTER>		<P>The tenth planet in our solar system, Vulcan was only recently		discovered. Early probes uncovered vast mineral riches, and within		a few years, commercial and government mining colonies sprung		up on the charted side of the planet. When <A HREF="theme.html#hope_station" TARGET="_self">Hope Station</A> was proposed in 2090, Vulcan was selected as an ideal site, offering		the farthest-reaching base of exploration for humanity's adventurers.		Meanwhile, mining on the planet's explored side continued to grow,		making Vulcan a cash cow for all involved.</P>		<P>In 2098, the discovery of a vast, abandoned <A HREF="theme.html#aliens" TARGET="_self">alien city</A> beneath the surface of Vulcan's enexplored side shook the scientific		world -- and the public -- to its core. In the year since that		time, a small research base has been erected near the entrance		to the city caverns.</P>		<P>Countless researchers, journalists, thrill-seekers, hustlers,		information spies, and xenophobes have all rushed to Vulcan and		Hope Station to get their piece of the action. Though all non-mining		areas of the planet are closed to the public for use by researchers		only, keeping the curious away from the 'digs' is a constant bane		for Hope Station's troops.</P>		<P><A NAME="esiban"></A>&nbsp;</P>		<CENTER>			<P><IMG SRC="images/esiban.gif" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ Esiban, Vulcan's Moon ]"></P>		</CENTER>		<P>The only natural moon of planet Vulcan, Esiban was purchased by		the <A HREF="theme.html#corporations" TARGET="_self">Weyland-Yutani Joint Stock Corporation</A> in 2078, in hopes of exploiting the tiny moon's minerals. With		the explosive growth of the mining colony on Vulcan, and the arrival		of Hope Station's one million inhabitants, The Company has harnessed		the moon in a far more lucrative manner.</P>		<P>Ten square miles of heavily terraformed land have become a forested		jewel on Esiban's surface; a small resort nestled in the lush		paradise is a frequent getaway for both station residents and		Vulcan's colonists. In recent years, it's even become an exclusive		vacation spot for those on Earth willing to brave a four-month		round trip.</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<CENTER>			<P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="469">				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="91"><A HREF="theme.html" TARGET="_self"><IMG SRC="images/theme.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ theme ]"></A></TD>					<TD WIDTH="91"><A HREF="news.html" TARGET="_self"><IMG SRC="images/news.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ news ]"></A></TD>					<TD WIDTH="91"><A HREF="links.html" TARGET="_self"><IMG SRC="images/links.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ links ]"></A></TD>					<TD WIDTH="184" ROWSPAN="2"><A HREF="http://www.wwa.com/~eaton" TARGET="_top" TITLE="Eaton Consulting"><IMG SRC="images/eaton.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="183" HEIGHT="43" ALT="[ Eaton Consulting ]"></A></TD>				</TR>				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="91"><A HREF="history.html" TARGET="_self"><IMG SRC="images/history.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ history ]"></A></TD>					<TD WIDTH="91"><A HREF="log-archive.html" TARGET="_self"><IMG SRC="images/log-archive.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ log archive ]"></A></TD>					<TD WIDTH="91"><A HREF="awakening.html" TARGET="_self"><IMG SRC="images/main.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ main ]"></A></TD>				</TR>			</TABLE>			</P>		</CENTER>	</BODY></HTML>
