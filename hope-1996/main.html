<H3>Notes</H3>
<p>The concept for Hope Station came about after a discussion of an original theme that had the same qualities as such grasping and successful stories like J. Michael Straczynski's Babylon 5, Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek, Issac Asimov's Foundation, Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, and Anne McCaffrey's The Dragonriders of Pern. [Webmaster's note: Caleb lobbied hard for Neuromancer too, can ya tell? *grin*]
</P><p>Credit for sections of this bible, appropriately go to Michael D. Garcia, aka Quinn (Economy, Sports, Timeline, Ummm... ummm... how about star-dot-star?); <A HREF="http://www.pobox.com/%7Eeaton">Caleb</A> (Corporations, Black Market Scheming, Conception Design [and lobbying hard for Neuromancer! Yeah! *winkwink*]); Dyria (Timeline Adjustments, Conception Design); Rebecca (Conception Design and Injector Of Evil Ideas), McCormicks (Military Design); and McLaren (Station Design). All are player names at the Nexus (<A HREF="telnet://nexus.tcp.com:2222">nexus.tcp.com 2222</A>).
</p><p>Hope Station is set in a time period immediately before a 'First Contact' with extraterrestrial life in our galaxy (and perhaps beyond).  The rotating station and starfighter concepts were created in tribute to Babylon 5, and the Exploration program in tribute to Star Trek.  If you look around the station, and read through the theme files, you can't help but see the influences by these great writers and visionaries, which have been captured here to not copy, but to pay homage to those concepts which I grew up with.
