Apple NetFinder Makes Distributing Documents Via the Web as Easy as Point and Click

<p>CUPERTINO, Calif., May 21 /PRNewswire/ -- Apple Computer, Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) today announced NetFinder, a Mac OS asynchronous common gateway interface (ACGI) for distributing documents via the World Wide Web, offering Macintosh ease-of-use to Internet webmasters and surfers.

<p>NetFinder lets administrators and webmasters of Mac OS servers distribute documents via the web, including software and product documentation, using Apple's familiar folder structures. No longer will webmasters have to use FTP or write HTML code to serve up files on the web.

<p>Previously, users connected to a server had to use FTP, Gopher or custom-designed web pages to retrieve these documents. Now, with NetFinder installed on a server, users will see an automatically generated HTML page that looks like a Macintosh desktop folder. Users can open folders and download documents by simply clicking on familiar icons.

<p>"NetFinder is one of many new products from Apple that support our recently-announced strategy to make the Internet as easy to use as a Macintosh computer," said Andy Lauta, product line manager of Internet products for Apple. "With NetFinder, webmasters will find it easier to use the Internet to share documents and keep their sites updated. End users get a friendly, Mac-like user interface which they can use to browse and download documents over the Internet."

<p>People who browse websites that incorporate NetFinder will find it easier to navigate through server content, read documents and download files. NetFinder brings the ease of the Mac OS Finder to accessing files via the Internet.

<p>NetFinder works with the Apple Internet Server Solution or any other Mac OS server running StarNine's WebSTAR. The beta version can be downloaded off the Internet, with a no-fee license, beginning today at: <A HREF="http://www.cybertech.apple.com">http://www.cybertech.apple.com</A>.
