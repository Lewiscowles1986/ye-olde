	<TT><B><A NAME="scifi" HREF="http://www.nmia.com/~aurora5">The "Science Fiction" Cover</A>...</B> While toying with my new copy of Kai's Power Tools, I decided I'd take a stab at a cover design for The Echoing Green's upcoming limited edition CD. A marathon Photoshop session followed; the accompanying image is the result.<br>The images are all taken from public domain Nasa image archives, with Kai-esque manipulations and Photoshop channel tricks. The "texture" in the background is actually text, obtained from NASA's archives. It's the relatively simple program that controlled the Voyager probes. Though the image was never used -- I created it for my own enjoyment -- Joey B, of the Echoing Green, reportedly thought it looked cool. :-)

	<TT><B><A NAME="scifi" HREF="http://gxl.woodtech.com/~virus">The "Virus" Cover</A>...</B> Spurred on by the Science Fiction cover, I later created this image for a non-existant CD by another ambient techno group, Virus. This has a "stark" feel when contrasted to te Echoing Green cover, using scanned-in hard drive components and a less friendly looking typeface. Once again, words are used in the background to add texture.

	<TT><B><A NAME="cover">The "ALT" Cover</A>...</B> During my days with ALT Magazine, I produced this image for a cover story -- an interview with Stu Weber, author of "Tender Warrior." The final cover featured the ALT banner in the upper left corner and the words "What Makes a Man?" on the puzzle piece. The most difficult part of the whole job was getting the scanned puzzle pieces to work as masks -- I was using PShop 2.0 at the time, and its masking features are put to shame by 3.0...

	<TT><B><A NAME="ac">The "Animal Couch" Cover</A>...</B> This one's still a bit of a work in progress, for a california indie alternative group named "animal couch." The cover design uses video captures exclusively; no photos and scanning. It's meant to evoke a feeling of isolation and regret, though some just say the flowers look pretty. *shrug* Back to the drawing board? *wink*
