<h2><CENTER> Apple Announces Website Searching Engine </h2></center><p>

CUPERTINO, Calif., May 30 /PRNewswire/ -- Apple Computer, Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) today announced the availability of Apple e.g. version 1.0 beta, a tool that makes it easy for Mac OS-based website administrators to add search and indexing capabilities to a website without having to learn or integrate complex search products.

<p> Using Apple's V-Twin technology, Apple e.g. enables webmasters, with a few mouse clicks, to produce a searchable website, thus allowing client browsers to locate and retrieve information with Apple's classic ease-of-use. Apple's V-Twin technology is a search engine that requires minimal memory and very quickly delivers search results that are relevance ranked, greatly minimizing the time it takes users to find specific information. Apple e.g. is one of many tools provided by Apple that enable Macintosh website administrators to quickly and effectively set up and maintain a website.

<p> "Apple's Mac OS-based Internet servers are, by far, the easiest to set up and administer, which explains why so many sites on the Internet are served from a Mac," said Andy Lauta, product line manager of Internet products for Apple. "With the availability of Apple e.g., these websites easily become searchable."

<p> Apple e.g. supports Apple's recently-announced corporate strategy to make the Internet as easy to use as a Macintosh computer while giving clear, distinct value to those on the Mac OS platform. Furthermore, it demonstrates Apple's commitment to leverage technologies across the company and accelerate the availability of Mac OS 8 capabilities. In addition to Apple e.g. and Mac OS 8, V-Twin technology is used in Cyberdog to search archived mail and news.

<p> Apple e.g.'s common gateway interface (CGI) works optimally in conjunction with the Apple Internet Server Solution or any Mac OS web server using StarNine's WebSTAR product, although Apple e.g. is designed to function with any Mac OS-based web server that supports CGIs. The product requires a minimum of 2MB of RAM and 1.5MB of disk space. Currently, Apple e.g. supports only 7-bit character sets, although subsequent versions will support 8-bit and double-byte character sets, thus providing truly international support.

<p> The beta version of Apple e.g. can be downloaded off the Internet, with a no-fee license, beginning today at: http://www.cybertech.apple.com. Approximately 100 beta sites are already using Apple e.g., including many prominent websites such as BMW (http://www.bmwusa.com) and Gallup High School (http://www.ghs.gmcs.k12.nm.us).
