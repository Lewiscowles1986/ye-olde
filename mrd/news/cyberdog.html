First Integrated Internet Suite Offers Tight Integration Across Internet Applications and Mac OS 

WWDC, SAN JOSE, Calif., May 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Apple Computer, Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) today announced shipment of Cyberdog 1.0, an integrated software suite that provides easy and intuitive access to Internet resources.  Cyberdog was released to thousands of developers at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference.  A consumer-oriented version of the product, including broad distribution, is planned for later this year. 

The advantage to Cyberdog is that it offers the first Internet suite of products with a common look and feel, offering easy drag-and-drop control across different Internet services, as well as tight integration with the Mac OS and Macintosh OpenDoc-compliant applications.  The result is that Cyberdog's browser, mail reader, Internet address notebook and news reading components are completely integrated with one common interface to accomplish Internet tasks.  Cyberdog's integration with the Mac OS and Macintosh applications embeds Internet resources throughout the user's work, making Internet connectivity an extension of the desktop.  For example, a user can drag and drop a live URL to the desktop, driving Internet links from the operating system rather than a browser. 

"Internet access has been dominated by the application browser," said Larry Tesler, vice president of Internet platforms, Apple Computer Inc.  "What Cyberdog offers is a new level of integration by putting Internet access directly into the Mac OS and Mac applications.  Instead of putting everything into the browser, Cyberdog puts the Internet into everything." 

OpenDoc:  The Technology That Brings Web Information Alive 

Cyberdog is based on advanced technology called OpenDoc that lets disparate software modules work together as a seamless application. OpenDoc is an open standard that is available to third-party developers to instantly make their applications interoperable with other OpenDoc applications, as well as Internet-enable them with a link to Cyberdog. The benefit of OpenDoc to end users is that it gives them the freedom to replace one of Cyberdog's components with one offered by a third-party. 

Cyberdog:  Tools for Managing Internet Use 

Cyberdog also provides DocBuilder, an OpenDoc application that supports inclusion of Cyberdog components, along with text and graphics. With Cyberdog's DocBuilder, and the availability of future OpenDoc- enabled word processing packages, users can create intelligent documents that combine text, graphics, data and information from the Internet.  A single document can contain previously disconnected combinations of sound, real-time Web site links, graphics, text and pointers to relevant newsgroups.  This document can be shared among Cyberdog users as "live" text which can be used to directly access the 'Net. 

These documents are a powerful communications tool because they easily organize and distribute Internet information and resources.  A corporate Internet support organization could use these documents, for example, to easily direct end users to those Internet resources they considered valuable. 

Cyberdog:  Superior Mail and News-Reading Features 

In addition to browsers for Web, Gopher, and FTP; telnet, notebooks for storing Internet addresses, and a log for tracking sites visited, Cyberdog offers superior mail and news-reading capabilities.  For example, Cyberdog can manage multiple email addresses, allowing users to easily manage incoming mail from various mailboxes.  Mail handlers can identify prioritized and unwanted mail, and categorize it for the user. Asophisticated search mechanism helps find emails by content, and can also archive Internet News Group Information.  In addition, the message editor for mail and newsgroups supports full-styled text, including graphics, and "CyberItems."  CyberItems are icons that represent links to Internet resources that can be easily clicked on to open and display resources, including Web sites, newsgroups, telnet sessions or files. 

Third-Party Developers Offer Cyberdog-Friendly Applications 

Numerous developers are already actively developing or enhancing applications to work with Cyberdog.  Making an application "dog savvy" is as easy as supporting OpenDoc, and instantly makes applications Internet-ready. 

For example, Macintosh word processing software vendors such as Claris, WorldSoft and Digital Harbor are supporting Cyberdog to enable their applications to develop "live" documents that link to Internet resources. 

In addition to Cyberdog-enabled "live" documents, developers are offering a host of capabilities to Cyberdog users.  Addison Wesley is developing interactive CD-ROM titles that use Cyberdog to retrieve content from the Internet; Corda Technologies offers a graphing component that uses Cyberdog to graph information directly to web pages; and OnBase Technology is offering users an alternative to the standard Cyberdog notebook. 

For developers, third-party suppliers are offering several tools to promote OpenDoc and Cyberdog add-ons.  Spyglass is offering a Web Technology Kit (WTK) that offers components for making applications, services or devices web-wise.  The Spyglass WTK supports Cyberdog as well as HTML browsers, giving users the option to plug in their preferred browser.  ResNova software has announced the development of a Java applet viewer for Cyberdog called "CyberJava."  This component enables the user to play Java applets within any OpenDoc document, not just Cyberdog components.  Kantara Development is offering developers "PartMerchant," an online source for buying and selling OpenDoc components that are based on Cyberdog. 

Price and Availability 

Cyberdog will be distributed free of charge on the Apple Web site (<A HREF="http://cyberdog.apple.com">http://cyberdog.apple.com</A>).  The Golden Master version is available today, with broader distribution planned for later in the year.
