<P>Don't want to slog through the narrative? The basics you need to know are all right here...</P>
<UL>
<LI>Humanity is very fragmented following a 25-year war with an alien race and the destruction of planet Earth. 1 Billion humans survived the war, from a total of 20 billion.
<P></P>
<LI>Most live scattered on various colonies, outpost stations constructed before the war, or 'homesteads' staked out on larger asteroids. Hundreds of these worlds exist, thought few hold over a hundred thousand individuals. Most average around ten to thirty thousand, the size of a small city.
<P></P>
<LI>The 'Earth Confederation,' once the sole government of mankind, is now another entity in the fragmented post-war political world. While certainly influential, it has neither the military power or influence to be any more than that at the moment.
<P></P>
<LI>Through the help of 'allied' worlds, the Earth Confederation has constructed Hope Station. The station can hold 5 million residents: an attempt to create a new cultural beacon for humanity and a military defense point in case of future alien attack, its 'spaceport' atmosphere also provides a tempting port of call for all those looking to make a quick buck.
<P></P>
<LI>Space travel is relatively common, with major advances in ship technology coming out of the war. The trip from Hope Station to Jericho Colony on Mars takes from two to five days in a fast ship. Slower ships can take up to three months. Small private ships are within reach of those who have the money.
<P></P>
<LI>Piracy is a major threat -- few dare to journey through the 'belt,' or make the long trek to Hope Station, without some sort of escort or defensive capabilities.
<P></P>
<LI>The black market is alive and thriving, and the governments make no move to stop it -- indeed, they often require its help in obtaining scarce supplies and equipment.
<P></P>
<LI>More to be added as needed!
