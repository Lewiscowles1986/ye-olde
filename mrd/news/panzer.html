SUNNYVALE, Calif., May 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI), today announced the release of the Power Mac, DOS, and the Microsoft(R) Windows(R) 95 versions of "Panzer General(TM)".  Setting this release apart from the norm is the inclusion of all three sku's on one CD ROM!

<p> One of the most successful games in SSI's history, "Panzer General" takes a fresh approach to computerized wargaming.  In fact, it's decidedly more than a wargame!  SSI has produced what it believes is the best of the best, combining elements from the best strategy game, the finest features of top selling wargames and topped off with state-of-the-art technology!

<p> Our leader starts his quest in Poland.  The year is 1939.  Success will bring more challenges, tougher battles and provide experience to his "Core" units to help manage the next series of confrontations. Prestige and influence are attributes which are earned, not given.  With his continuing success he may choose to fight his way through Norway, Belgium, France, and then on to North Africa and the Eastern Front.  If unsuccessful, he may find himself in a desperate defense of Berlin as early as 1939!

<p> Authentic World War II combat photography and film footage, along with CD quality music and dynamite sound effects, add to the suspense and realism of this Super VGA masterpiece.  Over 35 progressive scenarios allow players, if successful, to buy more than 350 types of units and equipment ranging from Tiger tanks to the B-17 Flying Fortress.

<p> One or two players can play a full campaign game, which will last over 60 hours, or the scenarios may be played independently as either side.  All unit types from the actual war are represented on-screen, including tanks, paratroopers, engineers, air forces, and naval forces. Players carry out their actions in multiple-impulse turns, allowing them to take actions such as reinforcement, movement, and attacking several times each turn.

<p> "Panzer General" is played with an easy-to-use interface that displays where a given unit can be moved after the player clicks on it.. Conflict is displayed with cinematics showing the destruction taken by both sides.  The map scrolls automatically for ease of interaction. Game play detail includes streamlined weather, attrition, and supply rules.

<p> "Panzer General" was designed and developed by the internal war game experts at Strategic Simulations Inc. "Panzer General is the best looking, most playable wargame SSI has published in our 15 year history," states Joel Billings, SSI's founder.  "The addictive quality of this game rivals the best strategy games on the market.  No one will walk away willingly!"

<p> "Panzer General" is now available for DOS, Windows 95, Macintosh, 3DO, and the Sony PlayStation.
