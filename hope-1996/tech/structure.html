<P>
	The primary frame of Hope Station is fabricated from a series of tritanium truss frames, in all hubs of the station.  To withstand the rotation of the hubs at one-hundred and twenty kilometers an hour, these trusses are constructed at an average of 2 meters in cross section, and are located an average of fifty meters across the hub's exterior.
