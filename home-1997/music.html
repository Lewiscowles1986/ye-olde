listen to <b>joy electric</b>. ocasionally referred to as nintendo-pop-techno, ronnie martin							sculpts electronic beeps, bloops, and clicks into catchy melodies							and angsty love songs. his latest releases, <i>robot rock</i> and <i>land of the misfits</i>, have moved beyond the sparse nintendo sound to explore dance-oriented							sounds, aphex twinnish snares, and other stuff. it's a love-it-or-hate-it							kind of group; i'm in the former category.</tt></p>							<p><tt><b>the vigilantes of love</b>. what more need be said?</tt></p>							<p><tt><b>massivivid</b> and <b>aleixa</b> are two immensely cool techno-industrial-dance groups. massivivid							has a rocky sound, with hard driving sample-wrapped rhythms and							quirky lyrics. aleixa has floating ethereal vocals and disturbing,							unsettling lyrics set to bouncing and grinding tunes. it also							has laurel, which is reason enough to buy the cd.</tt></p>							<p><tt><b>fleming and john</b> is a gifted husband and wife team with their roots firmly set							in the world of rock. their first cd, delusions of grandeur, combines							fleming's powerful, soaring voice with john's production and lickety-slick							guitar riffs. <i>a place called love</i> and <i>i'm not afraid</i> are two personal favorites.</tt></p>							<p><tt>sheri shaw</tt></p>							<p><tt>cloud2ground</tt></p>							<p><tt>iona</tt></p>							<p><tt>plumb</tt></p>							<p><tt>the electrics</tt></p>							<p><tt>phil keaggy</tt></p>							<p><tt>the black peppercorns </tt></p>							<p>&nbsp;</p>						</div>						<center>							<p><tt>[ more to come as i get time. <a href="index.html">go back home</a>. ]</tt></center>					</td>				</tr>			</table></center>	</body></html>
