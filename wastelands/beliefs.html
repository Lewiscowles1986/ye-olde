						<p>The 'Old World,' before the Great Death, is steeped in legend and lore. The great machines of the Old Ones and their 'Tech' are seen in old pictures, and discovered in ruins, though few have any idea what they are or how to operate them. Some, including many members of the Seers tribe, seek to discover more about the Old Ways and Tech, and spread the knowledge when it is ready. Others see the Old Ways as dangerous...</p>
						<p>Off-the-wall stories about the Old World and its wonders are the stuff of children's tales, but almost two centuries after the Great Death few people see them as more than legend. Livestock and farming are more immediate concerns, and a good horse is more valuable than fanciful tales</p>
						<p>Religious beliefs still exist, though they are understandably a bit different. With literacy almost nonexistant, and survival a priority, few have time for theology. Still, some hold to beliefs for hope, passed on from generation to generation.<br>
