<h2><CENTER> Apple Outlines Asian Net Strategy </h2></center><p>

Apple Computer officials said here on Wednesday that Asia was a key market for the company's Internet-related business.
<p>
<p>"Asia represents the best opportunity for Apple in the Internet," Vincent Lum, marketing director of Apple Asia, said at a presentation during the Intermedia and Internet Asia 96 exhibition in Singapore.
<p>
<p>He said Apple would deliver to Asia powerful and open-standard media solutions for both the Internet and Intranet. Intranet refers to internal networks of companies connected to the Internet.
<p>
<p>Senior officials said Apple was establishing partnerships and business and marketing alliances to bring such solutions to the Internet for its customers.
<p>
<p>Its MacIntosh computers would be "Internet ready" with an "all-in-one-box" connection kit that includes Netscape <NSCP.O> browsers, Claris Email, and Asian-based dialers for most Asian Internet service providers (ISPs).
<p>
<p>Users would have a choice of different ISPs.
<p>
<p>The company soon would provide Cyberdog, a suite of Internet tools that let users manage their Internet resources to fit the way they work.
<p>
<p>Apple products also have multilingual capabilities, said Lum.
<p>
<p>The company plans to be aggressive on the server front in Asia, offering cost-effective Mac operating system-based Internet and Intranet servers, he said.
<p>
<p>Apple is currently working on extending Internet access capability to its handheld devices, the Newton, and its new "information appliance," the Pippin. The Pippin, currently licensed to Bandai Co Ltd <7967.T> in Japan, connects to a television set and brings games playing and easy personal finance into the living room. It is not yet available in Asia, but shipments to the U.S. are expected in September. <p>
