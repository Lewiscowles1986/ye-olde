Opening Sessions Highlight Corporate Strategic Framework and Apple's Internet Technology Directions 
<p>
Across the globe, stakeholders of Apple Computer, Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) focused their attention on the Company's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) proceedings today, where senior executives articulated the framework for Apple's corporate strategy and the Internet initiatives underlying that strategy.  Thousands of developers gathered at the San Jose Convention Center, joined by satellite and Internet webcast audiences from around the world, as Apple Chairman and CEO Dr. Gilbert Amelio delivered the conference keynote address -- an assessment of the Company's strengths and his vision for the future. 
<p>
Dr. Amelio described the framework of a corporate strategy that will position Apple in front of the industry's key "mega-trends": convergence of computers, communications and consumer electronics; explosive growth in Internet use, and the demand for media-rich digital content.  He expressed Apple's intent to make the Internet central to the Company's strategy.  To support this strategy profitably, Apple will realign its structure to build a more effective, efficient, accountable organization. 
<p>
Internet Strategy 
<p>
As a central component of the Company's business model, Apple's Internet strategy was detailed in a WWDC opening session by Larry Tesler, Apple's vice president of Internet platforms and chief scientist.  The foundation of this strategy rests on three core concepts:  access, creation and delivery.  By leveraging its pioneering ease-of-use and multimedia competencies, the Company intends to help customers access, create and deliver information through innovative Internet/Intranet solutions that combine Apple hardware, software and third-party offerings. 
<p>
Apple's approach will rely on open standards that eliminate platform incompatibilities, giving customers from across the Company's key markets the freedom to choose systems on the basis of the enabling technologies that make access, creation and delivery more productive and rewarding. 
<p>
Avariety of robust Internet solutions are immediately available to Apple users.  The Company and several dozen of its third-party vendors showcased some of these shipping products, along with technology demonstrations of products under development, during an Internet Product Fair for WWDC press attendees at the San Jose Fairmont Hotel today. 
<p>
Product and Technology Announcements 
<p>
Together with its third-party allies, Apple introduced a multitude of new and updated developer products, technologies and services at WWDC.  The scope and quality of these announcements reflect the Company's progress in facilitating technology adoption through resources that add value to software applications and improve developer productivity: 

Attendees received the final developer version of Cyberdog, the acclaimed suite of OpenDoc-based Internet development tools.  The software suite helps third party applications carry Macintosh computing conventions to the Internet, simplifying the user experience with a powerful, intuitive interface. 

<MENU>
	<LI>Apple offered evidence of broad OpenDoc momentum, noting that hundreds of developers support this programming environment as an effective path to deploy applications across multiple platforms.  The Company also announced availability of a new OpenDoc Software Developers Kit (SDK).  Incorporated into the SDK is a new developer suite code-named KickStart, which packages Apple's superior multimedia technologies as easy-to-access OpenDoc components. 
	<LI>Underscoring the Macintosh's continued popularity among software development professionals, Apple and its third-party tools partners unveiled more than a dozen new tools products for the Macintosh platform.  Many of these products address Internet and cross-platform development needs. 
	<LI>Apple introduced the beta version of Newton Internet Enabler (NIE), a suite of connectivity tools that helps developers create Internet-based solutions for Newton Personal Digital Assistants.  An overwhelming number of third-party developers affirmed their plans to integrate NIE into current and future releases of their products, to deliver Internet-based solutions such as World Wide Web, electronic mail, news, Telnet and FTP clients. 
	<LI>Apple confirmed that it will license the Apple Image Capture Platform to camera manufacturers, developers and systems integrators worldwide.  Based on Apple's QuickTime Image Capture technology, the platform includes APIs which facilitate the creation of compelling customer solutions that don't require a computer, such as in-camera time lapse photography, direct connection to the Internet to share and transmit images, and in-camera filters. 
	<LI>The Company announced plans to incorporate Firewire -- the popular cross-platform implementation of the IEEE 1394 High Speed Serial Bus invented at Apple -- into its entire line of Macintosh products. The Firewire standard is unprecedented in providing fast, real-time connection between personal computers and new digital consumer products such as set-top boxes and digital video disk devices.

Apple on the Internet 
<p>
As an extension of its Internet strategy, Apple announced its commitment to lead by example in providing rich, meaningful Internet content to current and prospective customers.  Specifically, the Company plans to: 

<MENU>
	<LI>maintain more World Wide Web sites addressing topics of greatest interest; 
	<LI>increase coverage of live events through Apple-sponsored webcasts; 
	<LI>integrate more community-building activities into Apple's Internet presence; 
	<LI>improve navigational capabilities within Apple's Internet sites. 
</MENU>
<p>
Apple's deepening commitment as an Internet content provider is exemplified in its approach to WWDC WebCast programming.  Throughout the week, Apple's WebCast will include live audio and video of keynotes, chats with Apple executives and industry leaders, coverage of selected sessions, and "spy-cams" to capture candid action from the conference venue. 
<p>
In addition, other Internet-based services have been established to meet the special information needs of the developer community.  Apple's developer relations group introduced the Apple Developer Catalog (ADC) Online, an extension of the company's quarterly print catalog that features a complete range of tools and technical resources.  By moving to an online format, ADC (previously known as APDA) is instantly accessible to developers around the world.  ADC Online is located on the World Wide Web at: <A HREF="http://www.devcatalog.apple.com/">http://www.devcatalog.apple.com/</A>. 
<p>
Also, Apple Directions, the Company's award-winning monthly newsletter for developers, has been redesigned to position the publication's print version as a complementary facet of Apple's Internet- based news services.  Apple Directions is currently available in three forms:  as a monthly subscription-based print publication, in bi-weekly email digests, and on the World Wide Web at: <A HREF="http://dev.info.apple.com/appledirections/adtoc.html/">http://dev.info.apple.com/appledirections/adtoc.html/</A>.  The redesigned newsletter will debut with distribution to WWDC attendees on May 15. 
<p>

Apple's WWDC continues through Friday, May 17, with ongoing sessions by Apple executives, product teams and third-party sponsors; hands-on training; compatibility labs; a developer product and service exposition, and special events.  The conference is Apple's premier technical forum, designed to help attendees make strategic development decisions by providing in-depth information about the direction of existing and emerging Apple technology.
