The AerobrakeFlashing apopleptic lights in an assortment of colors assail the senses  from first entrance through the door.  Music throbs and pulses, the  low bass rumbling deeply enough to be felt as a tangible sensation  on the skin mirroring the throbbing of blood through the veins,  making just stepping through the door an overwhelmingly visceral  experience. To the left masses of bodies twist and contort in  various manners, moving to the inner rhythm of the stirring music,  glistening skin and sticking clothing visible with the flashing of  the strobe.  To the right, a bar, the music still too loud for easy  conversation, the rumbling low tones showing up as ripples in  glasses of the many specialty drinks prepared by expert bartenders.   People are attempting conversation anyway, shouting at each other  through five inch distances, bodies still moving to the compulsively  heavy beat, but only slightly, showing up as the tapping of a foot  or rhythmic nodding of the head.  Beside the bar is a door, wholly  unremarkable and shaded from the casual glance, leading into the  backroom maze of storage and offices.  Smoke machines work to  obscure most of the rest of the room, though there is much behind  that hazy screen, much indeed.NekoA finely boned but mature cat, still small enough to fit comfortably  into a shoe box, with fluffy white fur that swirls around her in  absently licked patterns, and blue-green eyes that deepen just from  being watched. Her tail is a little fluffier then the rest of her  and almost disproportionately long, as are her whiskers, both move  according to her mood. Her movements are light and graceful, and she  gives the impression of being /aware/ of her surroundings without  worrying about them too much.ErikErik Davidson wears his twenty-some odd years with a shy smile and a  gleam in his eye. Idealism of youth hasn't passed away; the boyish  innocence in his smile has simply been salted with experiences and  sights once dreamed, now known. His too-long blond hair hangs into  his eyes a bit, and he brushes it away with an unconscious motion.  Not unattractive, but far from a hunk, he wouldn't stand out in a  crowd and seems content with that.Erik wears a pair of baggy coveralls; far removed from the docks he once  worked in, the 'look' is still kept for reasons of style rather than  necessity. A pair of headphones dangle from his belt, next to a  yellow civilian badge.The pounding of bass doesn't faze Erik; he's got damping plugs in his  ears and is bobbing along happily to the tune. Leaning against the  wall only a few years from the DJ's booth, he sips at a drink of  some kind and smiles happily, watching the club's mid-day activity.Neko pads lightly into the room, tail held in a still, graceful arch  behind her. She peers around curiously as she stretches slowly, then  continues further into the room, whiskers twitching. She skirts the  crowd, and her ears slowly pin back, not angrily, but to keep out  the noise. At least some of it, at any rate.That's a difficult task for anyone in here; Erik is conversationless,  sipping at a glass of orange juice and alcohol of some sort. After a  few moments of looking around, he spots Neko -- And grins at the  sneaking feline. Wave wave!Neko stops only a little ways from the door, blinking blue-green eyes.  She sits down on the bottoms of her paws and leans forward a tad,  watching the people dancing. Whiskers twitch. Then her head tilts  upwards to catch the wave--somehow--and she mraaos, quickly standing  to pad toward Erik. >>Hi!<<As if anyone would notice if they weren't already looking. Erik pushes  away from the wall and threads his way over to Neko, grinning. "Hey  there, cutie!" He squats down once he reaches Nekos sitting place  near the door, setting his drink on the floor and offering arms for  the feline to occupy. "I haven't seen /you/ around here for a  while."Neko twitches her whiskers, crouching down briefly before she leaps into  Erik's unoccupied arms. >>Been busy.<< Importance tinges her light  voice, almost laughing for that matter. Neko goes about settling in,  stretching out a bit. >>Not really busy, just playing with  bond-mate. Likes to play.<< Happyness colors the feline's voice now,  perhaps at the thought of the attention.Erik does his best to offer support to the stretching-out feline,  snagging his glass by the rim with two fingers, then standing to  walk back to the deejay's booth. "So Tari's doing okay and stuff? I  haven't seen her around for a long time..."Neko draps her tail down Erik's arm, stretching out quite comfortably.  She seems a little longer then her small size would suggest. Tilting  her head upwards, she looks up at Erik with blue-green eyes, the  corners of her mouth seeming to turn up a bit, though they may not  really. >>Bond-mate's doing okay.. says she's been busy with the  books.<< Her mental voice seems to lower a bit, >>Think she likes  being busy.<< Mraor. >>Asks whether you're doing okay too?<<Erik smiles pleasantly at the inquiry as he sits down in thebooth, Neko  still cradled in his arms. "Oh -- I mean, tell her I'm doing really  cool, you know? She aughta come by sometime..." Grin. Who  /shouldn't/ come by the club, in Erik's opinion? It's the point  about which the universe spins, the Aerobrake is...Neko prraos. One of her ears swivels forward, almost cautiously, then  quickly flicks back again as the music seeps in. She keeps her head  tilted upwards, so as to peer at Erik. >>Says she will.<< Neko's  whiskers twitch curiously. A slight pause, and a mental soft  chuckle, >>Says I'm telling her it's so loud, she'll have to find..  earplugs?<<Laughter follows. "Yeah, it's loud!" As if to accentuate the comment, he  frees one arm from under Neko and reaches over to pull the mike from  the booth's table. "Okay, people, let's keep this /movin'/!   Remember, free drinks for the ladies comin' up in forty-five, and  tonight's Master Bash is one you don't want to miss!" Assorted  cheers and cat-calls from the room follow, and an unfazed Erik slaps  in a new set of disks. Awkward, with Neko in his arms, but hey --  friends are friends, right? "Tell 'er I can get her a pair... it's  no prob," h assures once the mike is off.Neko tilts her head forwards, whiskers twitching as she gives Erik's  drink a cursory sniff. >>Told her,<< she offers, settling back into  her spot without claws to get used to the removed arm. >>Why's it so  loud?<<It smells like odd-tinged orange juice, no less -- fruit with a twist of  something. Erik grins, twisting to reach for it without upsetting  Neko's position. "'Cause that's how people like it, you know? It's  loud, like.. umm.." Hmm. How to explain this? He twists a bit to  tilt back the glass for a drink. "It's like swimming in sound, you  know?"One of Neko's ears perks up as she follows the movement of the glass  with her head, mraowing lightly. Tail gives a swish. >>Swimming is  wet,<< the feline comments, then angles her head upwards, perring at  the odd orange juice.The start of one of the dancier songs brings a slight unconscious  bouncing to Erik's body. Humming along, and all that as a  melody-driven synth numbergets the crowd dancing like one giant  amoeba. "Well yeah!" Erik grins. "It's fun! It's like you're just  buried in all the sound, you know?" Bounce boucne bounce. He sips at  the drink, then waves it towards Neko slightly. "It's a Sunshine  Punch... mostly OJ," he explains before clinking at back down to the  table.Neko moves her head back a bit as Erik waves the glass in her direction,  whiskers twitching curiously. She peers at it for a moment or two as  it's returned to the table, then looks back up, arranging her  frontpaws over Erik's arm. >>Oh..<< Unsure, Neko sounds, but she  still slowly un-pins her ears, tilting her head slightly to one side  as if to catch the sound. Not that it's hard.Kind of like trying to drink from a firehose. "So Tari's been doin'  okay?" Erik smiles, running fingers along thee back of Neko's skull,  scratching lightly behind the ears as he continues to bounce in  place. Woo! /Good/ song. "I mean, has she been getting out and  stuff? You know."Neko tilts her head a bit more, rubbing it against Erik's fingers with a  feline grin. Tail slips into a slow swish, though its tip twitches  back and forth, independent of the rest and seemingly trying to get  the beat of the music. Just the hint of claws clutch at Erik's arm,  though, to make sure that doesn't start bouncing too. >>Bond-mate's  been okay..<< A slight pause, and directed to the second question,  >>?<<Uhoh. She wants clarification? Erik frowns a bit; "Well, you know --  getting out and meeting people and stuff? She's cool, you know? I  just wondered if she was like, you know..." Shrug. Something. Erik  glances back towards the crowd and makes a minute adjustment to the  equipment, nodding to Jon The Bouncer across the room. Looks like  everything's doing well..Neko stretches a bit, then settles back in, resting her head down on her  frontpaws. >>Oh..<< Tailtip gives another twitch-flick. Now the  feline peers about the room, perhaps watching everyone's 'strokes'.  Uncertainly, >>Don't think so.. just been at the bookplace.<<Hrrrrm. She hasn't been meeting people? Erik looks vaguely concerned,  but perks quickly. "Well, like, tell her she'll have to like, get  over here or something, or maybe head over to the new place on Veer  Square." A sly grin emerges. "I mean, I bet a bunch of the guys'd  like to meet her, you know?"Neko twitches her whiskers curiously, curling inwards a little more as  she apparently attempts to find a comfortable spot. Purr. The feline  seems to have succeeded in getting used to the music, somehow.  >>Bond-mate rolled her eyes,<< 'whispers' Neko, rather cheerfully.  >>But told her.<<Hee. "Well, cool." Erik seems rather pleased with himself and finishes  off the drink before responding. "Think she will?" It's asked  conspiratorially, for Neko's Ears Only, it seems.Neko yawns softly, showing needle-sharp white teeth. Then she raises her  head to peer back up at Erik, twitching her whiskers. A smile seems  to tinge her 'voice'; conspiracy is fun. >>Think she will.. said  she'd come here.<< A vocal shrug. Curiously, >>Come here a lot?<<Erik grins. "I /work/ here." So, yes, he's here more than he's anywhere,  really... "It's great, why?"Neko arches her whiskers forward a bit, peering up at Erik. >>Oh..<< She  yawns again, but briefly, and this time seems to settle into her  spot as she doesn't move from it. >>Just curious. Talk about it like  you like it a lot.<<"Well, yeah. It's cool, you know? I'd just be like, drifting and stuff  otherwise." Erik nudges at a set of discs as the music changes,  leaning back into his chair happily.Neko purrrs, resting her head back down on her frontpaws. A sharp bit of  percussion from the changed music elicts a flicked-back ear, and  both pin back at Erik's words. >>Drifting?<< Tail gives a lash."Y'know, jsut going around and doing random stuff and not really /doing/  something." Another nudge at the music. Tweak the highs and  midtones... queue up the next disc... "Not like this!" Grin. Massive  grin. Big o' heap of grin.Neko tilts her head up just a little in a rather careful manner, peering  at Erik with blue-green eyes. Her tailtip flicks back and forth,  back and forth, then slowly stills. >>Know. Sounds fun<<  cheerfulness returns to the light female voice, if just as slowly. A  little bit of emphasis on 'sounds'.Neko tilts her head in a different direction, leaning a bit to poke one  of the dials lightly with her nose.Well, sound is what it's all about, isn't it? Erik nods. "It is. What  kinda stuff--" Eep! The bass kicks suddenly, as Neko noses, and Erik  makes a bit of a correction and laughs. "What kinda stuff d'you do  for fun? And Tari?"Neko quickly moves her head back as the bass kicks, mraowing  surprisedly. Her tail swishes back and forth, though, and she tilts  her head slightly to one side, carefully climbing off Erik's arm  onto his lap for a better examination of the different, interesting  dials. >>?<<Alllllll kinds of tempting dials and knobs and buttons and... oh, my!  Erik squints back. "I mean, what kinda stuff do you like? I'll bet  Tari really digs the bookstore and stuff."Neko looks very, very tempted. She pads lightly to the end of Erik's  lap, craning her head forward to nose at one of the knobs instead,  mraaowing. Tail continues to swish. >>Likes the bookplace,<< Neko  replies lightly in agreement, tone overlayed with slight, distracted  curiousity. /Cool/ dials. >>Like the place with the flowers, and  hide and go seek, and tag. Like it when bond-mate reads to me,  too..<<Neko turns her head to peer at Erik over her shoulder, whiskers  twitching. >>Like a lot of things.<< She seems to smile, though it  may just be an illusion.More activity from the crowd draws Erik's attention -- and he leans  towards the mixing board a bit, putting Neko within swatting  distance. "Cool... she reads to you? Sounds like you're livin'  large," he grins. Fiddle tweak tweak.>>Living large?<< Neko sounds quizzically curious. Being as she's still  sitting on his lap, she carefully reaches a frontpaw forward, then  bats lightly at one of the dials, whiskers arching forward. >>Reads  to me.. like to see the people she talks about..<<Oof! There goes the bass! The music can now be felt in the lungs,  throbbing and thumping. Erik laughs -- and leaves the dial where it  is. "Yeah, you know! Livin' large! Like, having a great time!" Yep.  /Now/ he has to shout...Neko flicks an ear back, blinking slowly. Mraowr? >>Oh.. yes. Living  large.<< Twitching her whiskers, Neko tries the phrase on for size.  >>Like it<< Tail swishes to curl around her as she sits down on the  bottoms of her paws, bristling slightly in an uncontrollable manner.  For a cat, with hearing like hers, the music is probably deafening..  >>Makes the music louder?<< She bats at one of the other knobs,  curious despite the flicked back ears. How does this work?Andthatonemakesthemusicgoalotfaster... Eep! Erik does reach to make a  quick correction -- "That's the tempo mixer!" The crowd stutters at  the sudden musical twitch, but resumes its dancing after the  interruption is over. "You can speed it up or slow it dow or  whatever, but... um... you don't wanna mess with that," he assures.Neko draws her paw back a bit, curling it close to her chest as she  peers at Erik's correcting hand. >>Why not?<< she asks curiously,  whiskers twitching. Her fur is starting to bristle faintly, as if  the loudness of the music were causing an electric shock.See, that's a good sign -- it means the music is /juuuuuust/ loud  enough! "Well, I mean... the music'll sound really weird then, you  know? Like, too fast and too high, or too slow and too low..." Grin.  He waves at the board. "I mean, you can doo /anything/ with this!"Neko looks quite fascinated, twitching whiskers, fur standing on end and  all. She moves her frontpaw forward just a bit to brush it lightly  against another of the controls, slightly curled under it. >>What's  that do? Why is this sound just right, and that too fast?<< Neko's  tailtip twitches here and there as she peers at the dials."Cause that's like, what they made it to be like..." Erik struggles to  explain. The music is /supposed/ to be like this, yes? See? It's  intuitive... "But they like--" Ermf. Jon waves to Erik from across  the room, signalling something. "Like, it's not good to change it  /too/ much..."Neko fiddles the dial around just a bit, then slowly draws her paw back,  bringing it up to her mouth to clean delicately between her pawpads.  >>Changed it too much?<< Neko, by this time, looks significantly  larger then usual. Her fur is all fluffed out, and rather  odd-looking. She tilts her head downwards, shifting position to  attempt to smooth some of it down with her tongue.Erik grins. Par for the course when he's At The Helm. "Nah, it's cool --  just gotta be careful, you know?" Shifting carefully, he offers Neko  a jump down to the floor. "I gotta jam, Jon's calling, okay?"Neko pauses in her fur-cleaning to raise her head. Gooseberry jam?  >>Okay..<< whiskers twitch and she stretches a bit, sitting up as  tall as she can to rub her head against Erik's chin before leaping  to the floor. >>See you later, Erik..<<"And tell Tari to get over here, y'know?" Erik winks to Neko -- there's  that conspiracy again! -- as he stands and jogs towards Jon.  "Later!"Neko mraows cheerfully, grin stretching across transmitted thoughts.  This feline apparently loves conspiracy. She peers about for a  moment, up at dials and all, before she turns to gallop around the  outskirts of the crowd towards the door.Neko has left.
