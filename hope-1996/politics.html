<H1>Political Parties</H1>

<P>
Because of the democratic society adopted by the founder of the Earth Confederation, political parties continue to dominate the government.  Political parties of old include the Democratic Party, Libertarian-Republican Party, and the original Republican Party.  The new parties include the very liberal Technocratic Party and it's conservative counterpart in the form of the Educator's Party, and the large and ever-growing family of healers form the Hippocratic Party which platform includes many wide-spread health reforms and plans.

At present, President Otonashi is a member of the Educator's Party, with her Vice-President a member of the Technocratic Party, being the second-place winner in the planet-wide elections.  The Earth Council is currently spilt in majority between the Educators and the Technocrats.  SEE: Earth Confederation Government.
