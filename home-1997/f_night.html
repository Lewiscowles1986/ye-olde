The tables were deserted				now, nothing but flickering black lights and smoke from a hundred				old cigarettes left in the ashtrays. Eleven fifty-four. Somebody				in the crowd was trying to sing, and a hundred drunks joined in				with him, Old Langsene or something like that. The laughing, the				music, the happy gunfire down on the street...</tt></font></p>				<p><font color="#33cccc"><tt>He stared at the gouges he'd made in the tabletop -- two paths				crossing.

But she needed him. Somebody screamed behind him, celebrating				a second too soon, then everybody else jumped in. Midnight.</tt></font></p>				<p><font color="#33cccc"><tt>Through the door and into the Cuba night -- humid, with the sound				of parties and guns and music in the streets.
