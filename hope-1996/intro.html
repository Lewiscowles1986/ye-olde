Shortly after the turn of the century, the third world war broke out on Earth.  Throughout the twenty-first century, mankind repeats history, with the occupation of the tiny country of Kawait being the boiling point in the year 1999, to the slavery of the Cyborg until their rights are declared only twelve years later.  It was't until after three world wars that the people of the planet Earth decided to preserve themselves by unifying the planet in a large Confederation, with equal representation.  To prove to themselves that they had indeed taken the step forward in their own evolution, a large station is built in orbit around the recently-discovered tenth planet of the solar system, to serve not only as the springboard for exploration beyond the rim of the star system, but as the gateway to the human race for the rest of the Milky Way.  This is it's story.  Hope Station.
