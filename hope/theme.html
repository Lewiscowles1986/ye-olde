The ten		years of relative peace following unification brought much healing,		though recent strife and <A HREF="history.html#civilwar" TARGET="_self">political turmoil</A> between Lunaport and Earth have re-opened old wounds. The Earth		Confederation is a constitutional democracy, and maintains the		familiar 'party' system. The <A HREF="history.html#lunaport" TARGET="_self" TARGET="_self">Lunaport Autonimous Zone</A> is governed by an elected council of eleven citizens.</P>		<P><A NAME="corporations"></A>EarthConfed's economy is tied to a number of multi-planet corporations;		most jobs are related, directly or indirectly, to these corps		or their subsidiaries. As such, they hold immense political power,		and are in heated competition with each other for market share		in lucrative trades. Most work for end-businesses owned by corporations,		and the few who work directly for corps are paid well. Diplomatic		liasons, serving as intra-corporation negotiators, are paid extremely		well, as their jobs are critical for the corporate wheeling-and-dealing.</P>		<P>A system-wide distributed computer 'Net handles long-distance		communications and media transmission. News, music, books, films,		artwork... almost all forms of communication are borne on this		distributed network, and information on paper is considered old-fashioned,		or a work of art. (See <A HREF="#tech" TARGET="_self">Technology</A>.)</P>		<P><A NAME="sns"></A>Though the Stellar News Service (SNS) is the most visible source		of news, the Net's dominance has caused 'zines' and other home-grown		media to flourish. Most citizens use intelligent computer 'agents'		to find interesting news; few have the time or inclination to		spend their lives manually sifting through the flood of information		that's available.</P>		<P><A NAME="opposition"></A>Various political opposition groups and dissenters exist in addition		to the <A HREF="history.html#lunaport" TARGET="_self">Lunaport Autonimous Zone</A>; most noteworthy is the EEU. A terrorist faction opposed to the		EC's political structure, the EEU traces its way back to the now-defunct		<A HREF="history.html#ec" TARGET="_self">European Economic Union</A>. Rumors tell of an EEU base on Venus, established near the end		of the Union's heyday, but the EC's official position is to deny		the EEU's existance.</P>		<P><A NAME="phs"></A>Also worthy of note is the Protectorate of Homo Sapiens, originally		formed in the 2040's to counter the cyborg rights movement. Its		terrorist attacks against citizens with electronic implants have		intensified in recent years, and their public statements have		been critical of the excavations and research on Vulcan. Contact		with any alien technology or civilization, the PHS maintians,		is a threat to the survival of humanity.</P>		<P><A NAME="aliens"></A>&nbsp;</P>		<CENTER>			<P><IMG SRC="images/aliens.gif" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ Alien Ruins ]"></P>		</CENTER>		<P>After the crash-landing of a large transport disturbed planet		<A HREF="history.html#vulcan" TARGET="_self">Vulcan's</A> crust, tremors were detected at regular intervals. Further investigation		in late 2098 revealed the shocking source of these siesmic pulses:		an automated signal beacon of alien origin... and the entrance		to a complex underground cavern system beneath Vulcan's surface.</P>		<P>Within these artificial caves lay an vast abandoned city of alien		design, dormant for centuries beneath the planet's surface. In		the year following the discovery, humanity's attention has focused		on Vulcan and, by association, Hope Station. Faced with such a		treasure trove of information, researchers have worked laborously		to divine the mysteries of the alien city and its technologies.		Even still, lifetimes of work lie ahead...</P>		<P>Though access to Vulcan's excavation is restricted to researchers,		military patrols, and important visitors, humanity waits with		baited breath for news of the latest discoveries. All manner of		individuals have flooded the station to be close to events of		such import... and not all are pleased with the changes.</P>		<P><A NAME="hope_station"></A>&nbsp;</P>		<CENTER>			<P><IMG SRC="images/hope_station.gif" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ Hope Station ]"></P>		</CENTER>		<P>Hope Station is designed as a series of huge rotating cylinders,		or 'hubs,' nested winthin each other to generate artificial gravity.		The Commerce Hub is similar to downtown of a large city, with		of people, lots of noise, and tons of shops and businesses. The		Docking Hub resembles a typical spaceport, with a 'grittier' atmosphere.		The Residental Hub has the air of a college dorm, crowded while		still holding a measure of privacy. The Operations Hub houses		the station's hospital, security headquarters, and command and		control area. Command and Control and Engineering are restricted		to members of the military with sufficient rank and access.</P>		<P>Designed in 2090 and built over a period of six years, Hope Station		serves as humanity's first steps toward the stars beyond our system.		Hope orbits the tenth planet in the Sol system, two months from		Earth. Constructed to house a million citizens, it also carries		a contingent of almost one hundred thousand EC military and government		personnel, and is under the command of the Earth Confederation		Stellar Fleet. During the <A HREF="history.html#civilwar">conflict</A> with <A HREF="history.html#lunaport" TARGET="_self" TARGET="_self">Lunaport</A>, Hope Station and Vulcan served as a potential backup location		for the EC government.</P>		<P>With the discovery of the alien ruins on Vulcan (see <A HREF="#aliens">Aliens</A> and <A HREF="history.html#vulcan" TARGET="_self" TARGET="_self">Vulcan</A>), Hope Station also serves as a center of activity for research.		The military personnel of Hope also carry the responsability of		protecting Vulcan's treasures from opportunists -- looters, pirates,		anti-alien xenophobes, and curious adventure seekers all make		the job a difficult one.</P>		<P><A NAME="tech"></A>&nbsp;</P>		<CENTER>			<P><IMG SRC="images/technology.gif" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ Technology and Communications ]"></P>		</CENTER>		<P>Communications and computer technology have advanced greatly,		with 'hardware' advances reaching a relative plateau in the late		2070's. Most research since that point has concentrated on AI		and communications technologies, hoping to make existing hardware		'smarter' and more adaptable.</P>		<P><A NAME="tech_scribers"></A>Scribers, ubiquitous 'smart notepads,' pack the power of a twentieth		century supercomputer into a portable device the size of a paperback		book or large notepad. A scriber's high-speed wireless connection		ot the net, voice recognition, and flat panel stylus-sensitive		display make it convenient and versatile. Those with the need		for more powerful tools use terminals, table-top machines that		pair scriber technology with more flexible harware. </P>		<P><A NAME="Anchor"></A>Cloning and bioengineering have advanced, though human cloning		is highly illegal. The creation of new, bioengineered species		by corporations and researchers is frowned upon, but allowed under		certain circumstances. Human genetics and neurology leaped forward,		particularly in the 2050's, leading to new developments in disease		fighting.</P>		<P><A NAME="Anchor"></A>New understanding of human neural functions has also led to experiments		with direct neural interfaces to computer hardware. The expense		of these devices (a decade's wages for all but the wealthiest)		puts them out of the public's reach. Still, a handful of die-hard		hackers and Netheads consider them 'tools of the trade,' worth		the loans and sacrifices needed to afford them. The <A HREF="history.html#phs" TARGET="_self">Protectorate of Homo Sapiens</A> sees these implants and other prosthetics as 'impurities,' leading		humanity down a path of destruction.</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<CENTER>			<P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="469">				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="91"><A HREF="theme.html" TARGET="_self"><IMG SRC="images/theme.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ theme ]"></A></TD>					<TD WIDTH="91"><A HREF="news.html" TARGET="_self"><IMG SRC="images/news.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ news ]"></A></TD>					<TD WIDTH="91"><A HREF="links.html" TARGET="_self"><IMG SRC="images/links.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ links ]"></A></TD>					<TD WIDTH="184" ROWSPAN="2"><A HREF="http://www.wwa.com/~eaton" TARGET="_top" TITLE="Eaton Consulting"><IMG SRC="images/eaton.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="183" HEIGHT="43" ALT="[ Eaton Consulting ]"></A></TD>				</TR>				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="91"><A HREF="history.html" TARGET="_self"><IMG SRC="images/history.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ history ]"></A></TD>					<TD WIDTH="91"><A HREF="log-archive.html" TARGET="_self"><IMG SRC="images/log-archive.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ log archive ]"></A></TD>					<TD WIDTH="91"><A HREF="awakening.html" TARGET="_self"><IMG SRC="images/main.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="20" ALT="[ main ]"></A></TD>				</TR>			</TABLE>			</P>		</CENTER>	</BODY></HTML>
