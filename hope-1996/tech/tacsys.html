<H3>Plasma Cannon</H3>

<P>
	In the latter half of the 2070's the Pacific Community discovered a way of harnessing plasma energy from fusion reactors, in a form that could be used as a weapon.  Because of this new energy source, large mounted cannons were constructed in 2096, and placed on all destoryers and new fightercraft.  Plamsa cannons do a tremendous amount of damage to an unshielded hull, putting a hole approximately twenty meters in diameter into it.  (The actual mechanics of this weapon need to be worked out... will work on it in a later draft)
</P>

<H3>Spatial Torpedoes</H3>

<P>
	Utilizing the anti-matter/matter principle, these torpedoes are loaded with an anti-matter charge, which detonates at the specified coordinates, or upon impact, if programmed correctly.  If targetted correctly, four torpedoes could easily take out a Carrier, and thus they are classifed as anti-space station weapons.
</P>

<H3>Shielding</H3>

<P>
	At thie time, Stellar Fleet R&D is looking at the possibility of an energy shield which could deflect the above weapons, but is currently in research only.
</P>

<H3>Personal Weapons</H3>

<P>
	Aboard Hope Station, projectile weapons are considered to be a threat, since they can puncture the hull and cause massive disruptions in life support, etc.  Energy weapons are carried by security and military personnel stationed aboard Hope Station.
</P>

<P>
	Some of these weapons include the C.A.P. (Capsulized Autofiring Plasma) Gun, based on the same principle as its larger cousin, the mounted plasma cannon.  Also, the rifle version of the C.A.P. Gun, which also fires bursts of plasma energy, lethal to human flesh upon contact.
</P>

<P>
	An alternative to this lethal weapon, is the TEDS or Tactical Electric Defender/Stunner.  This device, when aimed at a target less than fifty meters away, releases a high voltage charge in the form of a charged bolt, using the principle of two conductors (1. The device and 2. The target).
