<H1>The History of the Bastet</H1>

<P><A NAME="species">The species known as Felus Superior originated as part of the governmentally-funded Project Bastet, which occured on Luna at Lunaport Colony.  After over ten unsuccessful attempts, the project's goal of enhancing and augmenting what were hypothesized as 'dormat' skills, such as self-telekinesis and latent empathy.  The project was declared a failure, and the only 'surviving' subject, a white female kitten, was kept by one of the project members as a housecat.</P>
<P><A NAME="disappearance">One week later, the kitten disappeared.</P>
<P>The Bastets began to first show up on Hope Station, where the kitten who had disappeared bonded to one of the station's residents, the kitten's (Neko) origins completely unknown.  After Neko's first litter, the Bastet population boomed aboard the station, and some kittens were smuggled back to Earth, and the rest of Confederation territory.</P>
<P><A NAME="growth">The Bastet kitten, when born, doesn't have any control over it's abilities, until the mother 'trains' them over the next six weeks or so, when the kitten is ready to 'bond' with a human.  Some kittens 'jump' after the six weeks, to another location, whether it be a different part of the planet/base/station, or another planet/base/station, although this range of 'jumping' hasn't exactly been documented, but reports of kittens suddenly showing up out of the blue are common.  Also, some kittens have been known to die without cause, or not bond with humans due to their abilities not being developed and live out as a normal housecat, with none of the Bastets' skills.  There have been some rare cases reported where the telekinesis skill is so strong, the cat can move not only itself, but objects and humans, as well.  These kittens aren't threatening, as once bonded, they can sense right from wrong by the emotional response of the human bondee.</P>
<P><A NAME="telepathy">Humans and Bastets 'think' conversations to each other, and Bastets can communicate with other through the same process.  Only a human can 'listen' to their bonded Bastet.  There have been some reports of humans who are able to listen to /all/ Bastets, but never confirmed.</P>
<P><A NAME="looks"></A>Bastets come in five different types, as the genome was originally confined to white, black, orange, and calico fur.  The fifth type, Siamese, came about after an accidental cross-breeding.  Bastets can mate with normal housecats, however, the veterinarians society has advised that bondees (As the term owner was thrown out when the Bastets showed their remarkable intelligence) try and prevent another cross-breed mating, as the kittens aren't guaranteed to survive, or an incident such as the second test subject (which ended up with tremendous and uncontrollable telekinesis and telepathy) may occur.</P>
