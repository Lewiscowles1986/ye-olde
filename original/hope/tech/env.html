<H2>Life Support</H2>

	Life support uses a combination of actual flora, the CO2 scrubber and circulators which then reciculate fresh O2 back into the environment.  The system has been flawless, thus far, and has several backups to keep it in operation.

<H2>Gravity Generation</H2>

	The rotation of the station is maintained at 120kph, generating a 'field' of gravity at 1g.

<H2>Waste Management</H2>

	(Well.. I'll let this one go free... you guys can figure this one out ;)
