						<p>Wastelands is a freeform roleplaying environment -- it's here to give you the opportunities to express your creativity, and have fun! There are some basic guidelines to make sure that everything goes smoothly, and everyone enjoys themselves.</p>
						<p><img height="29" width="366" src="titles/communicating.gif"><br>
						Communicating is important! If you have questions or complaints about something, talk to us! Contact a member of the player staff [Type 'wstaff' when connected for a listing of staff members] and chat about it. We'd rather talk it over beforehand and work something out than have to contact someone after the fact if there are complaints.<br>
						</p>
						<p>his doesn't mean that you have to double-check everything before RPing it! Just respect other players, keep the theme in mind, and realize that occasionally, the staff has to poke in and say, 'Hmmm, that might not work for this theme...' In those situations we'll do our best to make sure that everyone is satisfied with the outcome.</p>
						<p><img height="29" width="366" src="titles/what_you_know.gif"><br>
						See '<a href="technology.html">technology</a>' for more information on the level of technology in the theme. This should be a guide to how knowledgable your character is about things technical. Characters are welcome to 'find' relics of the old-tech around Seattle or in the ruins of old buildings, etc. Keep in mind, though, that hundreds of years have passed. Scavengers, roving gangs, and the elements have taken or destroyed all the stuff that's *easy* to find.</p>
						<p><img height="29" width="366" src="titles/finding_your_tribe.gif"><br>
						Wastelands' theme centers around the conflict between two tribes in the ruins of Seattle [see '<a href="tribes.html">tribes</a>' and '<a href="main.html">theme overview</a>']. New players are encouraged to join, or at least hang around, one of the two groups in order to get situated. The usual 'post-apocolyptic drifters' are always welcome! Visitors from afar are sure to generate excitement, though it may be more difficult to get involved long-term with that type of character.</p>
						<p><img height="29" width="366" src="titles/knocking_heads.gif"><br>
						Combat in Wastelands is consentual, meaning that you should work out what's going to happen with those involved, and get their permission, before knocking heads. Conflict is a daily part of life in the harsh world of this theme, but respect for other /players/ is a must even when your character wants to kill their character. Remember, In-character conflict is fun. Out-of-character conflict isn't! See '<a href="combat.html">combat</a>' for more information.</p>
						<p><img height="29" width="366" src="titles/dont_ignore.gif"><br>
						Some information in these news files is for the information of players, and is not known by characters in the theme. For example, a member of the Seer tribe would not *know* that his abilities are the result of a nanotech virus, just that 'tech from the old world' has made them what they are. The Seers are regarded with much suspicion and distrust *because* of the mysterious nature of their abilities. None of the Strongmen know that their Leader is really a centuries-old computer AI; few have ever seen or spoken to the Leader, and those who have just 'don't understand' what he is.</td>
