<p>WWDC, SAN JOSE, California--May 13, 1996--Asserting its commitment to provide Internet connectivity across all product platforms, Apple Computer, Inc. today announced the availability of the beta version of the Newton Internet Enabler (NIE)  for Newton 2.0, a suite of connectivity tools that allows Internet-based solutions development for Newton Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), including the Apple MessagePad. NIE will enable Newton developers to deliver Internet-based solutions such as Web, mail, news, Telnet and FTP clients.
<p>"The Newton TCP/IP stack for developers is a key component to implementing our Internet strategy for the Newton platform," said Sandy Benett, acting vice president of Apple's Newton Systems Group. "In the very near future, we can expect to see an exciting range of innovative Internet-based solutions for Newton, developed specifically for the mobile customer who requires seamless access to the Internet and/or an Intranet, regardless of location."
<p>"For the past two years, Internet connectivity efforts have been focused on the desktop environment," said Andrew Seybold, editor-in-chief, Andrew Seybold's Outlook on Communications and Computing. "The growth of Internet-based enterprise and commerce applications is driving an increased need for mobile Internet connectivity. High-functionality PDA platforms like Newton will play a significant role in providing that connectivity."
<p>In addition to TCP/IP, Newton Internet Enabler also provides support for standard Internet protocols such as PPP, SLIP and UDP, a dialer with a script engine and a domain name resolver (DNR). Applications can now be developed which ultimately allow customers to connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) whether it be via a public ISP or through a corporate Intranet.
<p>The beta version of NIE is available immediately free of charge to all Newton developers worldwide. This beta release will be available via electronic distribution by submitting a request to: <A HREF="mailto:NewtonDev@applelink.apple.com">NewtonDev@applelink.apple.com</A>. The final NIE release is expected to be available in June 1996. <p>
