<H1>Dissentions, Protests, and Movements</H1>

As with every form of government, there are factions of people within the society that wish for radical change beyond the current form of governemnt.  The following are a list of all such conditions, whether they are known or not.

<H2>The EEU</H2>
Members and citizens of the former economic union from the early twenty-first century secretly inserted a colony and base on the planet Venus, masking it from Earth Confed sensors and space patrol vessels.  Isolationistic and violent in the conservative extreme, the EEU fiercely protect themselves from contact with the rest of the human race by covertly propogating their beliefs of a reorganized Earth, and planning a coup of EarthConfed.  The organization is currently unconfirmed, and the base and colony aren't known to EarthConfed or the Earth Confederation Armed Forces, however, SF's hierarchy has suspicions.
SEE: Section Five.

<H2>The Protectorate of Homo Sapiens</H2>
A vendictive group of racist citizens who operate mostly by using corrupt individuals to frame and degrade the Cyborgs who roam freely about society.  Earth Confederation suspects that this group has close ties with the EEU, however, this assumption is completely unfounded and untrue.

<H2>Russian Rangers</H2>
Based somewhere in Siberia, this misguided group of former Alliance officers are dedicated to turning the clock back to the old economic unions, when the Alliance prospered.

<H2>Students for the Stars for the People (SSP)</H2>
  Based in Berkeley, North America at the University of California at Berkeley, one of the oldest institutions on the planet.  SSP's platform include a complete and total economic reform, and the dismantling of the Earth Confederation Armed Forces.
