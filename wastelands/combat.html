						Wastelands: Rebirth is a consent based, freeform roleplaying environment. That means that there are no 'coded' commands for combat like 'hit,' 'kick,' 'kill,' etc. Although there's a lot of conflict in the post-apocolyptic world, handle it with consideration to other players. If you're going to attack someone, send them an out-of-character page and make sure that everything is OK.
						<p>For example, 'Hey, your character is hanging around the city; I'm going to take a shot at him, and try to capture him, OK?' You don't have to choreograph everything, but making sure there is an understanding between PLAYERS makes conflict between CHARACTERS a lot more fun.</p>
						<p>Keep in mind, of course, that putting your character into life threatening situations will obviously bring about consequences. A Seer sneaking into the Strongmen's lair should realize that they'll be captured and probably hurt. The same goes for a Strongman poking around the Seer compound. Although everything is voluntary, using the 'consent' system to repeatedly escape mortal danger is tacky. Miraculous escapes and brushes with death happen, but folks probably won't play with you if you ALWAYS deny the realistic consequences of your actions.</p>
						<p>If you want to leave things up to chance, the @roll command is just what you're looking for. Talk to the other player involved and decide what the 'options' are for a particular scene. IE, 'You'll jump me, and I'll either fight you off after a struggle, or you'll subdue me.' Then type something like: '@roll Will I fight off Bob's attack?'</p>
						<p>The @roll command will respond with: '[ROLL] Jim asks, 'Will I fight off Bob's attack?' YES. (67%)' The Yes or No answer is determined randomly, and the percentage determines how 'close of a call' it was. It's a simple system meant to add 'chance' to the mix, and is not designed for resolving player disputes. It's also voluntary -- it can't be used to force another player into doing something they don't want to do.</td>
