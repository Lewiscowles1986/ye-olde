<h2><CENTER> Vatican Art on CD-ROM </h2></center><p>

In an exclusive worldwide arrangement with The Vatican Museums, E.M.M.E. Interactive has introduced "Sistine Chapel"  and "The Vatican Paintings Gallery,"  two multimedia CD-ROMs that offer an inspiring treasury of images encompassing the artistic heritage and grand history of the Vatican.  The two titles are the first in a collection of CD-ROMs authorized by the Vatican Museums that will be published over the next few years.

<p>"Rather than offering mere collections of pictures and brief descriptions of significant works of art, "The Sistine Chapel" and "The Vatican Paintings Gallery" provide an escorted tour and engaging narrative about these glorious representations," said Philippe Guttieres-Lasry, founder and President of E.M.M.E. Interactive (pronounced em), and current head of the European Multimedia Federation.

<p>"Produced under the direction of Luca Di Mata and a group of art historians, these titles employ high quality images and rich, stunning details to offer a captivating look at these famous works of art.  Available in Windows and Macintosh versions, these titles are certain to arouse an affinity for these magnificent works of art," he said.

<p>According to E.M.M.E., "The Sistine Chapel" offers a first-time opportunity to view the details of the beautiful recent restoration of Michelangelo's frescoes in the chapel via multimedia CD-ROMs. The title contains over 400 full color photographs and illustrations that help the user learn about Michelangelo's masterful techniques, and his breathtaking frescoes.  Users will also discover other masterpieces by Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Perugino and others that decorate the walls of the Chapel.

<p>A virtual reconstruction of the room helps orient the user at any point in the program.  Clicking on any section allows the user to view a specific fresco and learn more about it.  E.M.M.E. said the multimedia experience is enhanced by the added dimension of music, and the first public release of historical documents from the Vatican archives.

<p>Prepared in collaboration with curators from the Vatican Museum, "The Vatican Paintings Gallery" documents European art from the 11th to 20th centuries by examining hundreds of masterpieces, including works by Giotto, Fra Angelico, Raphael, and Leonardo da Vinci.

<p>The user can access the Vatican's impressive collection of paintings in several ways, including a thematic search function, which allows for comparison of the different ways various artists have treated similar subjects through the centuries.  Timetables and timelines allow the user to navigate through hundreds of masterpieces, grouped according to their major themes.  A helpful reference glossary accompanies an interactive database of the exhibited works.
