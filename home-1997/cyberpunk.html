Sometimes it's because you're poor, or Irish						or Jewish or Catholic or ugly or simply that you are skinny. But						if you are reasonably intelligent and if your anger is deep enough						and strong enough, you learn you can change those attitudes by						excellence, personal gut performance, while those who have everything						are sitting on their fat butts.</i></tt></p>						<p><tt><i>&quot;Once you learn that you've got to work harder than anybody else,						it becomes a way of life as you move out of the alley and on your						way. In your own mind you have nothing to lose, so you take plenty						of chances, and if you do your homework many of them pay off.						It is then you understand, for the first time, that you have the						advantage because your competitors can't risk what they have already.						It's a piece of cake until you get to the top. You find you can't						stop playing the game the way you've always played it because						it is a part of you and you need it as much as an arm or a leg.</i></tt></p>						<p><tt><i>&quot;So you are lean and mean and resourceful, and you continue to						walk on the edge of the precipice because over the years you have						become fascinated by how close to the edge you can walk without						losing your balance.&quot;</i></tt></p>						<p><tt><i>Richard Nixon, 1974</i></tt></p>						<p><tt><b>so, what is it?</b></tt></p>						<p><tt>The cyberpunk genre is an offshoot of traditional science fiction						that rose to prominence in the early 80's; deciding what defines						it is often as difficult as asking blind men to describe an elephant.						Cyberpunk is often characterized by a dystopian near-future society,						a global emphasis that reflects current trends in economics and						politics, and pervasive high-technology.</tt></p>						<p><tt>Characters are often loners, or punks on the edges of society						who must use their wits to survive and better themselves. Hacker						street gangs, high-tech storm chasers, professional street samurais,						renegade AIs and mega-corporations, neural computer interfaces						and pocket-sized fission weapons... the images and flavor of the						genre are gritty, often soaked with dark humor and satirical twists						on current trends.</tt></p>						<p><tt><b>the history of cyberpunk</b></tt></p>						<p><tt>The first Cyberpunk authors frequently published short stories						in magazines like Omni and Isaac Asimof's Science Fiction. Known						informally as the Mirrorshades Group, they brought a fresher contemporary						flavor to their writing, in the same way that punk music in the						late 70's had reflected postmodern culture. Neuromancer, by William						Gibson, was one of the first novels to go achieve widespread recognition						in 1984. The story of a hacker 'cowboy' hired to steal an AI from						a powerful corporation, it coined the term Cyberspace, and put						cyberpunk on the map.</tt></p>						<p><tt>Bruce Sterling, another of the genre's founding fathers, wrote						classics like Heavy Weather and Islands in the Net, and edited						the Mirroshades anthology, a diverse compiliation of classic cyberpunk						stories. Niel Stephenson's Snow Crash marked a second generation						with the story of a down-and-out hacker whose pizza delivery mishap						catapults him into a war between the mafia, the government, and						a power-hungry communications tychoon.</tt></p>						<p><tt><b>cyberpunk related links</b></tt></p>						<p><tt>it's more than a movie: <a href="(Empty Reference!)">blade runner</a> was an is one of the major influences on the look and feel of						classic cyberpunk. the smogged,  arcology-filled los angeles is						still a work of art.</tt></p>						<p><tt><a href="(Empty Reference!)">max headroom</a> was the first (and only true) cyberpunk television series. brilliant						stuff, with the tongue in cheek bungee-jumping-off-a-burning-bridge						feel that makes the great cpunk fiction so fun.</tt></p>						<p><tt>if you're looking for info on the man behind neurmancer, <a href="http://sfbox.vt.edu:10021/J/jfoley/gibson/gibson.html">the william gibson page</a> is the place to go. book summaries, news about other projects						he's working on, and a chic design make it a nice place to visit.</tt></p>						<p><tt>bruce sterling's <a href="(Empty Reference!)">cyberpunk reading list</a> is a moral imperative.you like cpunk, this man can show you the						roots of the genre, back when people didn't know what to call						it. </tt></p>						<p><tt>though it's still under development, <a href="/Captain%20Crunch/Desktop%20Folder/untitled%20folder/mirrorshades/">mirrorshades</a> is my personal brainchild. an original cyberpunk world set in						the 2030's. a media-centric world with paranoid advertisers pulling						the strings, it's got some grit and some cheese thrown in for						good measure.</tt></p>						<p><tt><b>some of my own stuff...</b></tt></p>						<p><tt>as you may have guessed, i am about to inflict my own cyberpunk-flavored						scribblings on you, the humble reader. they're tiny little sketches,						not stories, but they're mine and they've been uploaded. check						out <a href="(Empty Reference!)">watching</a> and <a href="f_night.html">one long night</a>, with other short sketches yet to come.</tt></p>						<center>							<p><tt>[ more to come as i get time.<a href="index.html"> go back home</a>. ]</tt></center>					</td>				</tr>			</table></center>	</body></html>
