<H2>Ships of the EC</H2>

<P>
	Hope Station sees many vessels, but the ones of major technical importance to those aboard are the Stellar Fleet's Ships of the Line, as you'll see below, the major technical aspects and specifications for each one of the ships.
</P>

<H2>Fusion Powered Ships</H2>
<H3>McCaffrey Class Carrier</H3>
<P>The McCaffrey Class Carrier was first manufactured at the Independance Fleet yards in orbit around Luna.  There are currently only one of these carriers in active service, with four more planned over a two-year production schedule.  The ECSS McCaffrey being the class ship of the line.  Scheduled ships include the ECSS Gagarin, ECSS Lexington, ECSS Hood, and the ECSS Straczynski.</P>
<P>Approximately 5000 meters in length, this carrier is the most heavily armed class of ship, with over twenty large AFPC (Automatic Firing Plasma Cannon) turrets, mounted every one hundred meters.  It carries over five thousand in crew, pilots, and troops.  Auxiliary craft include twenty short-range shuttles, five long-range shuttles, and sixty fightercraft.</P>
<P>ECS McCaffrey is the Stellar Fleet's flagship, also the flagship of the Green Fleet, which includes one carrier, three destroyers, and five various support craft, making patrols of the entire solar system.</P>

<H3>Agamemnon Class Fast Fusion Destroyer</H3>
<P>The Agamemnon Class Fast Fusion Destroyer was first manufactured at the San Diego Fleet Yards on Earth.  There are currently fifteen destroyers in active service, with ten more planned over a two-year production schedule. The ECSS Agamemnon is the class ship of the line.</P>
<P>Approximately 500 meters in length, the Agamemnon class is the fastest ship of the class, able to speed at the rate of over 1,000kps, the only other craft to achieve a higher speed is the Maripose class Shuttle.  This destoryer has five mounted AFPCs, one fore, one aft, one ventral, one dorsal, and the other mounted dorsal-fore.  This destroyer carries 80 in crew and troops, and can transport, but not launch, two wings of fightercraft (20).  Two shuttles, one long-range and one short-range, are launchable from the destroyer's aft bay, just below the AFPC.</P>

<H3>Freidman Class Medium Fusion Destroyer</H3>
<P>The Freidman Class Medium Fusion Destroyer was first manufactured at the San Diego Fleet Yards on Earth.  There are currently twenty destoryers in active service, with forty planned over a five-year prodecution schedule.  The ECSS Freidman is the class ship of the line.</P>
<P>Approximately 300 meters in length, the Freidman class is primarily utilized for escort and patrol duty only.  This destroyer has three mounted AFPCs (One fore, one aft, and one ventral), and five auxiliary charged pulse cannons (Two dorsal, two fore, one aft).  The Freidman class carries fifty in Fleet officers and crew, no shuttles or fightercraft.</P>

<H3>Mariposa class Long-Range Shuttle</H3>
<P>The Mariposa class Long-Range Shuttle was first manufactured at the Central Lunaport Auxiliary Construction Yard on Luna.  There are over one hundred and fifty shuttles in active service, with another one hundred planned over a two-year production schedule.  The ECSS Mariposa is the class ship of the line.</P>
<P>Approximately 50 meters in length, the Mariposa class is used for transporting of military personnel or dignitaries of the government.  The shuttle is armed with three mini-AFPCs, all mounted fore.  It can carry two in crew and eight in passengers.</P>

<H2>Thruster (Rocket-powered)</H2>

<H3>Confederation Class Small Rocket Destroyer</H3>
<P>The Confederation Class Small Rocket Destroyer was first manufactured at the San Diego Fleet yards on Earth.  There were twenty destroyers in active service, five of them are currently left.  Five have been mothballed, and nine have been dismantled.  One has been retired to the Smithsonian Air&Space Musuem's Jericho Annex.  The ECSS Confederation was the class ship of the line.</P>
<P>Approximately 20 meters in length, the Confederation class was used for short range patrol in-sector only.  The Confederation class was armed with nuclear torpedoes, with rocket-powered propulsion, and eight pulse turrets. It carried ten in crew.</P>
<P>There are plans to retrofit the five ships in active service to carry a fusion engine and two AFPCs.</P>
<H3>Short Range Shuttles</H3>

<P>
	One-man shuttles which could carry six passengers at a time.  No armament, no shielding.
</P>

<H3>Fightercraft</H3>

<P>
	(Unfinished... we'll have to work on this as soon as I get a frame of what I want to do with it...)
</P>

<H2>The Future</H2>

<H3>Tannhauser's Theory</H3>

<P>
	Early in 2097, Franz Tannhauser successfully experiemnted with the notion of travelling at the speed of light, or beyond, and thus his theory was considered valid by the Earth Confederation Science Division, and testing is to begin at Uranus in February of 2097.
