<H1>The European Economic Union (EEU)</H1>

<P>Considered to be a major threat to the Earth Confederation, with the original confrontation in 2076, by the ESS Berlin.  The EEU is determined to overthrow the Earth Confederation and replace it with a dictatorial monarchy.  It's leaders are unknown, it's resources are unknown.  The only remnant of the EEU is a small, isolated colony and military base on the surface of Venus, obscured from the EarthConfed and Earth Confederation Armed Forces by the violent storms on the planet they now call home.
</P>

<P>Earth Confederation Armed Forces hypothesizes that the EEU may have five small destroyers in it's fleet, housed on the surface.  Earth Confederation refuses to acknowledge the EEU to the public.
