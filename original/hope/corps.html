<H1>Corporations & Business</H1>

<P>
The Earth Confederation's economy is tied tightly to a relatively small number powerful multi-planet corporations; approx. 89% of the jobs available in the Earth Confederation are related, directly or indirectly, to these entities or their subsidiaries. As such, these corporations hold immense political power, and are in vicious competition with each other for market share in lucrative trades.
</P>

<H2>Background</H2>

<P>
During the tumultuous and conflict-ridden years before the unification of Earth's governments, the Pacific Community prospered greatly, largely due to the economic influence of thriving businesses based in its territory. Businesses and corporations in other territories were hampered by regional strife and major wars; the PC's neutrality in all but one minor conflict allowed its economy to produce and sell, rather than funding military efforts. Beginning in the years following WWV, a period of intense mergers and takovers took place; by the 2080's, Earth's economy was in the hands of approx. 30 multinational corporations and their subsidiaries or divisions. Although most were based in the PC, due to its stability, all had significant ties to the EEU and AA; conflict between those two parties proved lucrative, increasing prices for almost any product in affected geographical regions.
</P>
<P>
With the merging of world governments in 2090, the former PC was forced to rebuild the rest of the war-torn world. While the government had ample coffers, thanks to decades of prosperity, this process strained it greatly, making it more dependent on the corporations for financial backing. Though the corporations are, strictly speaking, under the law, they are in a very influential position, controlling the wealth of the Earth Confederation.
</P>
<P>
Although some smaller companies and businesses do remain, from the days before the merging, few have been able to survive; the corporation 'whale' often swallows up the minnow without much remorse.
</P>

<H3>Employment</H3>
<P>
From simple grocery stores in small towns on Earth to major industrial factories on Mars, jobs can be traced in one way or another to corporations. Those who work directly for a corporation, or one of it's more visible subsidiaries, are paid far better than those whose jobs place them farther away from the "power centers." Connections are important in obtaining such a job -- family ties to other corporate workers, friends, etc, are all useful. Diplomatic liasons, serving as intra-corporation negotiators, are paid extremely well, as their jobs are critical for the wheeling-and-dealing that form most corporate business strategies.
</P>

<H3>Government Contracts</H3>
<P>
Space exploration and contruction of space stations/spacecraft, while technically a function of the Earth Confederation government, is often handled by corporations or independent contractors working through corporations. The computer net that acts as the communication system of Hope-Station, for example, was designed and constructed by MachTel Inc, whose bid was approx. 120b MU's lower than the closest corporation, ApTech Incorporated. ApTech (often referred to as "Apple/IBM;" see Corporation Index) received the contract for construction of the Hope-Station controller AI, a sentient computer to control many of its vital functions and time-critical engineering tasks.
</P>

<H3>Contractors & Merchants</H3>
<P>
Most corporations make heavy use of contractors, merchants, and freelance cargo haulers (exceptions include PepsiCoke, Novani, and ApTech, all three of which offer lifelong employment). MacTel's construction of the Hope-station computer net, for example, was supervised by MacTel employees and carried out by independent subcontractors working under the corporation's authority. With the increasingly lucrative orbital stations and colonies desiring corporate services, freelance freight haulers are hired on a contingency basis to transport goods and corporate personnel.

<h2>Major Corporation</h2>

<P>
<B>MachTel Inc. </B>-- One of the largest corporations; major subsidiaries include INexar Systems (communications backbone hardware, semiconductor manufacturing, AI development), Kargen Industries (weapons development & manufacturing), and Cyronics Technologies (biological engineering, cyborg manufacturing, medical research). Numerous other divisions and subsidiaries specialize in other areas, but over 70% of MachTel's gross revenues are derived from the three listed above.
</P>

<P>
<B>ApTech, Inc </B> -- Commonly referred to as Apple/IBM, this corporation operates almost exclusively in the area of "high tech" development: semiconductor design and manufacturing, artificial intelligence research and creation, and software design. The joint corporation was formed by spin-offs from Apple and IBM in the late 2040's; the two companies had cooperated successfully in their AI research and split off their respective AI divisions to form a separate company -- ApTech. ApTech thrived even after Apple and IBM fell on hard times a decade later, aquiring both companies along with semiconductor giant Motorola. MachTel, Inc. competes directly in all ApTech's fields of expertise, though ApTech's tighter focus on computer technology industries has allowed it to maintain higher market share than the giant.
</P>

<P>
<B>Novani Corp.</B> -- Novani's major areas of influnce cover food products and services (78% contracted with independent growers, 22% grown in corporate hydroponics labs), medical technology, and bioengineering. One of Novani's highest grossing divisions is a private 'research thinktank;' individual projects or areas of specialty for said division are undisclosed. Novani offers a particularly encompassing employment plan, in which employees become members of the Novani 'family,' and are offered employment for life. Tatooing of the Novani logo on an employee's inner wrist is quite common, and serves as a simple way for 'Novani siblings' to recognize each other.
</P>

<P>
<B>Weyland Yutani Joint Stock Company</B> -- Often referred to as "The Company," this entity is a relatively focused corporation; almost 70% of its revenues are derived from a single division (terraforming). The company is dominant in this field, though -- 8 of 9 recent EC terraforming contracts were awarded to Weyland-Yutani. Remaining 30% of revenues divided between bioengineering, weapons technology, manufacturing, industrial communications equipment (sat relays, etc).
</P>

<P>
<B>PepsiCoke </B> -- While it is often referred to as a corporation, PepsiCoke is actually a subsidiary of Sulaco Inc, a food products and services corporation. Only 23% of Sulaco's revenues come from PepsiCoke (whose products include its namesake soft drink, and almost a dozen "fast food" and convenience store chains), but the remaining 77% of revenues are brought in by a host of small subsidiaries. PepsiCoke is, therefore, the most visible of Sulaco's subsidiaries and is often confused with the mother corporation.
</P>

<P>
<B>Disney-Paramount </B> -- Not much needs to be said regarding Disney/Paramount. This entertainment giant is the dominant force in film-making, and also operates a mind-boggling network of franchising and licensing subsidiaries. DisneyCo Entertainment, one of its better-known subsidiaries, is charged with the operation of DisneyWorld, formerly know as Io, the moon of Jupiter. The massive entertainment 'world,' terraformed for Disney/Paramount by the Weyland Yutani Joint Stock Company, caters to a variety of interests. Most notable are the 'Adventure Lands(tm)' -- specially engineered mini-ecosystems designed to simulate locations and periods from Earth. Popular adventure lands include SafariLand, RainforestLand, and Aleins, an adventure land based on a 20th century movie. Animal rights activists have long protested Disney/Paramount's practice of creating biologically engineered 'docile' versions of dangerous creatures for use in its Adventure Lands(tm).
</P>

<P>
<B>SNS</B> -- Stellar News Serivce, a conglomerate media entity formed by the old-media CNN service, and spin-offs from Viacom, ApTech, and Disney-Paramount. Makes use of full-time reporters, production crew, and many freelance "stringers" to report on news throughout the Earth Confederation.)
</P>

<P>
<B>Mitsubishi</B> -- Mitsubishi is one of the oldest megacorporations, second only to Viacom Ltd. Its internal organization and structure are not well-known; It is, however, a major competitor to MachTel in several key areas.
</P>

<B>Viacom Ltd</B>. --

<B>Panitech Industries </B> --
