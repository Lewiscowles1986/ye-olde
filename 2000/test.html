			I didn't expect it to hurt so much when she disappeared. Her presence was one of those natural assumptions about the universe; she might been gone for an afternoon here or on vacation for a week there, but those were just interruptions. Brown-outs in the light that her words brought to my world. I never realized how much I'd come to depend on her, and spent the first few days blithely unaware of any deeper impact. Friday, I drove home from work with a mental diary of what I'd accomplished. Amusing things I'd overheard, projects I'd tackled. Thoughts about life that I'd tucked away. I stopped at the corner of Naper Road and President, near-blinded by the glow of the sunset over the buildings. It warmed my face, bathed me with orange light and the promise of a quiet night. I thought of her, instantly, and startled myself with the association. Scared myself. I spent the night in the bedroom, watching IRC inch by without knowing why I was there. Hunched in my chair in front of the blue-glow monitor, tapping halfheartedly, absently, going through the motions of when-she-used-to-be-there. This time, though, her words were gone. My kindred spirit was gone, and the creep of my words up the screen was hollow. I didn't sleep that night. Eight and one half years ago I was a very young boy with very many books. My father, an enthusiastic and well-meaning engineer, prodded me towards the wonder that was the family computer. His eagerness, his passion for this wonderful new toy, was enough to carry me through the first few months of experimentation. Though I showed no interest in his programs or video games or tricks to calculate pi with the press of a key, the seductive worlds of text adventure games fascinated me. OPEN DOOR, I would type finger-by-finger, or GO NORTH. And so I would. A new room, or a new cave, or some marvelous treasure would appear before me in spartan prose. It delighted me. They sculpted worlds from words, one of my journal entries read. It was a revelation to a young boy who loved words more than anything else. I discovered that words could weave not just stories, but places. Things. Inside that box, I knew instinctively, words were reality. To my father, though, they were a distraction. The computer itself was the thing to be enjoyed, the chips and disks and codes that hid inside its beige case, not silly descriptions of cottages and castles. I was to learn to program, he said, and I laughed. Why, I asked him, would I want to? Because, he answered, frustrated and inarticulate. I remember the words I used to cut him off, drawing my command of the language like a knife, smug at his impotence. And so I abandoned it and returned to writing, as I always had, with my pencil and pad and the smears of graphite on clean white paper.</div>
