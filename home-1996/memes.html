<P>The obvious question for many, upon clicking, might be, "So, what's a meme, anyhow?" 
</P>

<TT><P>according to the <A HREF="http://locke.ccil.org:80/jargon/">Jargon File</A>...

<UL>
	<LI><P>Meme: meem/ [coined by analogy with `gene', by Richard Dawkins] n. An idea considered as a replicator, esp. with the connotation that memes parasitize people into propagating them much as viruses do. Used esp. in the phrase 'meme complex' denoting a group of mutually supporting memes that form an organized belief system, such as a religion.</P>
</UL>

<P>So what, one might ask, are memes doing on this web page?
</P>

<P>Simple question, simple answer: this page is a greenhouse, a display pen, a zoo, if you will, for notable memes, plucked from the ether of the net, culled from literature, and created from scratch over late-night cans of Mountain Dew. Browse, enjoy, and ponder for yourself.

<FONT SIZE="6">Good does not <B>require evil</B>, as light does not require dark. Contrast is <B>not dependence</B>.</FONT>

<P>Good is a positive that exists in and of itself; <B>though our perception</B> of it may be clarified by comparison with evil, good does not <b>depend</b> on evil for its existance.</P>

<P>To say that <B>the two depend on each other</B> may be a trendy adaptation of classic yin/yang balance concepts, but it leads to an erronious -- and dangerous -- <B>blurring of the lines</B> between objective good and evil. Just as a lit room is light, whether or not the closet in the corner is dark, good would still be objectively good and positive, were evil not to exist. Though there would be no <B>source for comparison</B>, the issue would be human perception, rather than objective reality.</P>

<FONT SIZE="6"><B>lie to a liar</B>, for lies are his coin; <B>steal from a thief</B>, for that is easy; <B>lay a trap for the trickster</B> and catch him at the first attempt, but <B>beware of an honest man</B>.</FONT>

An interesting <B>Somali proverb</B> points out 'handles' that open us for manipulation. Those dark sides that we <B>exploit can become chinks</B> in armor as well...

<!--Evil is from within, not without.  That which is in our environment merely activates the evil that is within our hearts. --matt laswell

This group is not exactly known for 'iron sharpening iron.' It's more of an 'iron congratulates other iron for  being so shiny, and cuts the heads off puppies.'      --Dallas Koehn

"Finally, when you are old and gray, and no longer want toffee, the corner store gets in a whole case of it... When we have learned to love God more than our earthly dearest, it is then that we shall love our earthly dearest more than before." --C.S. Lewis
