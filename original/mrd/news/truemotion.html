<h2><CENTER> TrueMotion&reg; Video to Hit the Desktop </h2></center><p>

The Duck Corporation has announced that it will market and distribute its TrueMotion(R) video compression technology, along with products based on that technology, to the desktop marketplace.  Applications using video compressed with Duck's TrueMotion will now be available for desktop-related activities including computer-based training, entertainment and the Internet.  TrueMotion is currently the leading software-only compression solution for video game developers, licensed by diverse companies including Sega, Viacom and Acclaim Entertainment.

<p>Horizons Technology, Inc. (HTI), under a new licensing arrangement with Duck, retains a continuing non-exclusive worldwide license to market certain products based on TrueMotion.  HTI was formerly TrueMotion's exclusive licensee for non-game, PC/desktop applications.

<p>"As entertainment and computing platforms merge and the definition of what is done on the desktop expands, Duck sees tremendous opportunity for the proliferation of video-based applications," said Stan Marder, CEO of the Duck Corporation.  "The agreement enables Duck and HTI to provide TrueMotion as a source of television-quality video across multiple platforms - both current and future."
