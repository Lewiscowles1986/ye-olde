						his hands are calloused<br>
						skin chocolate dark<br>
						as i press two quarters<br>
						into his palm<br>
						just as i would<br>
						any of my friends<br>
						what can i say<br>
						is it suburban<br>
						guilt<br>
						that tugs at me<br>
						to make a call i say<br>
						to him<br>
						and he nods<br>
						flashing his grin<br>
						his eyes<br>
						i can't meet them<br>
						for a moment<br>
						then he starts away<br>
						with a quick<br>
						thanks brother<br>
						i shake his hand<br>
						before he can leave<br>
						clasp it grip it<br>
						for a moment<br>
						god bless you man<br>
						and he pauses<br>
						bless you too<br>
						brother<br>
						and then<br>
						i can smile<br>
						is it my imagination<br>
						it probably is<br>
						to think that<br>
						four words<br>
						from some pale<br>
						thin geek<br>
						could mean anything<br>
						but i can hope<br>
						pray<br>
						that something more<br>
						than two bits<br>
						changed hands<br>

			I was young... how often does a six-year old scratch beneath the
			surface? <br>
			<br>
			i remember sitting around her kitchen table, at the extravagantly
			late hour of 9:00. I could sit at the table and listen as she
			and the other relatives talked and drank &quot;spootnicky&quot; -- alcohol
			of some kind; I don't know what the name was, but that's how i
			pronounced it. I could crunch away on my planters cheese puffs,
			and she even LISTENED when my opinionated, 7-year old voice piped
			in and added its two bits to the discussion.<br>
			<br>
			I was her last grandchild, the baby that she could pamper with
			open favoritism. toys, gifts, snacks, attention... I truly was
			spoiled by her. But what I treasured most, even then, of all the
			things I received, was her attention. Her smile, her playing War
			(the card game, not the military conflict) with me at the kitchen
			table over 7-up (for me) and liquor of some sort (for her). Both
			of us had shot glasses -- I thought that they were ever-so adult
			and sophisticated. When I was at her house, I would want nothing
			else to drink my soda pop in.<br>
			<br>
			we would talk while we played cards, pretending to be high-society
			elite, discussing diamond mines, the stock market, the economy.
			I would take one of her cut glassware cups from the shelf and
			say it was made of diamonds, and she would make wide eyes and
			say, &quot;Oh, my!&quot;<br>
			<br>
			I don't know what would happen if she were alive now. If I would
			still be able to touch hearts with her... I think I would; she
			cared about ME, I believe, and our relationship would have grown
			with the years. I don't know, though... I would be a different
			person than I am now. I don't know who that person would be.</tt></p>

			<p><tt>Some of my most vivid Christmas memories are associated with my
			grandparents' rather small house in Elkhart, Indiana... a 'built
			in the 30's' sort of house with peeling paint and light switches
			worn smooth-edged by decades of fingers. My grandmother was an
			amazingly outgoing, active woman... hosted an grand Christmas
			celebration for the family every year, packing the place with
			three generations of presents and present-givers. We were very
			close; I was the youngest of any of the grandchildren and the
			one she could spoil, lavishing both gifts of things and of /herself/
			-- her time and attention, which I treasured more than any toy.
			Christmas was a chance for the little 6-year-old boy to share
			in the excitement not just of the season, but her preparations
			and the buzz of activity surrounding the festivities. She made
			the most delicious cherry squares; sinfully sweet and delicious.
			I've never tasted anything like them in my life. After we'd all
			eaten and the adults had settled in for conversation before opening
			presents, I would sneak another of the squares and she wouldn't
			mind. Then I would slip in and listen in with fidgety eagerness
			and wait until the paper-tearing moments... the nights usually
			stretched from late afternoon to the wee hours. The memories are
			treasures.<br>

			<p><tt>Friday night, Dave and I drove out to see Ben play an accoustic

			We edged over and listened intently, inhaling the smell of coffee,

			<br>
			&quot;I've never heard any of Ben's songs,&quot; Dave whispered to me carefully.

			gang -- everyone broke up and started chatting. Lighting up smokes
			and talking about concerts and clubs and the latest gossip. A
			jaded looking blond with a lacy black tank top and a kanji tattoo
			on her shoulder was telling Jason about his sign. I wandered over
			and commented that if the pull of a star can seal your fate at
			birth, then the nurse who helped deliver you has even more effect.
			Jason and the girl blinked and squinted at me, facing into the

			&quot;What's that supposed to mean?&quot;<br>
			<br>
			&quot;We shouldn't be checking dates. We should be weighing nurses.&quot;
			Behind me, Dave chuckled and I shrugged. A few minutes later she
			asked if we had any piercings. I noped, and asked what her tattoo
			meant.<br>
			<br>
			&quot;Love,&quot; she answered, twisting to show me her shoulder, flicking
			ash from a lucky strike. She smiled.<br>
			<br>
			&quot;What's it mean, though?&quot;<br>
			<br>
			She looked back, puzzled for a moment by the repeated question,
			then got my point. &quot;Something everyone spends their life looking
			for, and not many people find.&quot; She smirked at me and lifted a
			shoulder. Shrugged.<br>
			<br>
			&quot;Any luck so far?&quot;<br>
			<br>
			She paused, thinking about it instead of tossing out a sharp comback.
			&quot;Not so far.&quot; A sad smile, and she turned, looking for someone's
			lighter.<br>
