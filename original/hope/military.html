The organization has a military academy at Annapolis in North America, with training and annex buildings littered along the colonies and stations where civilians make up at least a quarter of the population.  Entrance into the academy can be done by any recruiting officer on any outpost, but when schooling begins, the cadet must be shipped back to Earth for the first year, then off to whichever colony/station/outpost of which the cadet specializes in.  The following is a list of the colonies, stations, and outposts that have Academy annexes:

<P>[The following are excerpts from "Modern Astrodynamics", by Lt. Colonel Dolores J. Nastair, (ret.), SForce.]</P>

<P><H3>The A-15 (Nicknamed: Stardancer)</H3></P>

<P>This fighter was one of the first to be constructed for escort duty in conjunction with the Steller Fleet's new Confederation class destroyer. Dependable and reliable, this fighter is the oldest and the ECAF's mainstay design, with a gullwing look, colored in a bluish-gray, to honor the ancient jet fighters of the previous century.</P>

<P>Problems first occured with the Stardancer when it was used in atmospheric warfare, three test pilots lost their lives when their craft literally broke apart in 2071 to fierce winds and post-reentry procedures.  The attack craft has been designated space-only, and continues to make up a fair percentage of the Stellar Force.  Plans to halt construction on this faithful design have been made for 2098.</P>

<P>The standard armament for the Stardancer is three particle projectile cannons mounted upon the tips of the wings, and one mounted just under the nose.  The damage output of the Stardancer is still formidable, in the new age of the Automatic Firing Plasma Cannon (AFPC).  Stardancers are generally reserved for escort duty, and are slowly being outmoded by the newer, faster designs.  The A-15 was first manufactured by Lockheed-McDonnell-Douglas in 2055.</P>

<P><H3>The A-111 (Nicknamed: Warthog)</H3></P>

<P>Built with the intention to replace the Stardancer with it's ability to fight not only in vacuum conditions, but weather the intense temperatures of reentry, and continue fighting using it's aerodynamic design.  Straying from the gullwing look of the Stardancer, the Warthog looked closer to the ancient F-16 Falcon of the Pacific Community's Air Force of 2010 (which was retired in 2011, after many years of reliable service).</P>

<P>Pilots using the A-111 will first notice the fighters lack of handling in space, as opposed to the impressive multi-directional thrusters of the A-15, which makes the Warthog a better pursuit craft, than a stellar dogfighter. Aerial dogfighting, however, is what the A-111 excels in, by far, outshining every other modern fighter currently being produced.  Heavy durasteel armor makes this craft invulnerable to gunpowder-based weapons, however, one direct plasma hit will literally shred the fighter's armor and pierce the thruster compartment.  There have been no plans made to halt construction on this craft, however, Boeing Astronautics reported their contract with the Earth Confederation will expire in late 2101.</P>

<P>The standard armament for the A-111 is two particle projectile cannons mounted upon the fuselage, under the wings, as well as a retrofitted single Automatic Firing Plasma Cannon mounted inside the forward nose.  Warthogs are excellent escort craft, but are losing their reliability with the new AFPC system weighing them down in aerial combat.  The A-111 was first manufactured by Boeing Astronautics in 2070.</P>

<P><H3>The B-221 (Nicknamed: Stellarfortress)</H3></P>

<P>During it's preconception, the B-221 was originally designated as a stealth starfighter, with the ability to hold five person, each one designated on different systems.  The Joint Chiefs abandoned that project, but Lockheed-McDonnell-Douglas adapted their design to produce the Stellarfortress.</P>

<P>Clunky, slow to respond, and often referred to as the 'Beast of the Stars' by bomber captains, the Stellarfortress only allows for one pilot, and five gunners, one on every firing arc of this large craft (Port, Starboard, Aft, Dorsal, and Ventral), while the pilot is able to man the forward weapons. The B-221 is the favorite amongst all of the bomber-designated craft, for it's reliability and the ability to withstand major firefights, most notably the output from a fully charged AFPC.  Stellarfortresses don't see much duty, as the bomber is primarily used for attack runs on major capital ships.</P>

<P>The standard armament for the B-221 is six AFPCs mounted facing out from the bomber for better targetting of oncoming craft.  The payload of choice for the Stellarfortress are eight concussion torpedoes mounted under the wings, and six multi-warhead fusion torpedoes, ejected and powered up from a minimum distance of ten klicks, then launched.  Unfortunately, this valiant bomber's production has been halted by the Confederation Council's Military Appropriations Committee, in favor for contracting the new B-224, revealed in a report from Lockheed-McDonnell-Douglas.</P>

<P><H3>The B-224 (Nicknamed: Stellarliberator)</H3></P>

<P>Faster, lighter, and definately pound-for-pound a superior fighter/bomber, the B-224 utilizes the first mini-fusion drive, enabling it to jump sectors of the solar system, without the aid of support craft.</P>

<P>The redesigned fusion drive feeds more power to the AFPC-II system, allowing for better handling, and faster response times.  The Stellarliberator dogfights at an average level, and can outmanuever the A-111 and on occasion, the D-110 Hornet.  This bomber has the ability to interlink the mounted guns on each of the firing arcs to one control in the cockpit, but allows for five gunners to sit in the pods, which is the preference of the Stellar Force, although the interlinking system performed well under fire.</P>

<P>The standard armament for the B-224 is six AFPC-IIs mounted facing out from the bomber.  The payload of choice for the Stellarliberator are ten concussion torpedoes, mounted under the wings, plus four multi-warhead fusion torpedoes, also mounted under the wings of the craft, as the bay was removed from this design, to make the B-224 handle better.  Production on this craft began in 2096, by Lockheed-McDonnell-Douglas, for a fifteen year contract.</P>

<P><H3>The D-110 (Nicknamed: Hornet)</H3></P>

<P>Prior to it's current training duties, the D-110 was the mainstay of the early Stellar Force.  At the academies, this craft has become the 'Cessna' of the Stellar Force, all pilots make this quailification within their first year, due to its simplistic controls and manueverability.  It's a short, sleek, one-man craft, adopting the gullwing design of the A-15, but colored in black.</P>

<P>Fast and furious!  The D-110 is a hit-and-run fighter, but has been known to hold it's own in a dogfight, however it's pre-durasteel armor is prone to disinigration upon a direct hit from an AFPC, which is why the Hornet is serving out it's latter year as a training craft only.</P>

<P>The standard armament for the D-110 was two particle projectile cannons mounted forward of the cockpit on the tips of the wings.  They have been replaced by the modified pulse laser system (MPLS) for wargames.  Production on this craft began in 2055, it was halted in 2095, and all construction was contracted by a joint venture between Lockheed-McDonnell-Douglas, Boeing Astronautics, and Stellar Dynamics, Inc.</P>

<P><H3>The D-117 (Nicknamed: Firefox)</H3></P>

<P>The fighter of choice for carrier escort duty, the D-117 is well-known for it's ability to intercept and obliterate the target from an exceptionally long-range, second only to the F-411.  The Firefox takes on an angular design, looking more like a spider, with it's split, angled wing design.</P>

<P>Moderately fast, and slow on handling, this tough bird can take more than it's share of direct AFPC hits before being damaged beyond it's ability to defend or fight.</P>

<P>The standard armament for the D-117 is two AFPCs mounted forward from either side of the fuselage, underneath the wings.  Armed to the teeth with torpedoes, notably twelve to eighteen long-range concussion torpedoes. Production began on this design in 2090 by Stellar Dynamics, Inc.</P>

<P><H3>The D-120 (Nicknamed: Hellfire)</H3></P>

<P>Early conceptual designs for the contracted D-120 included a variation on the A-15's design, by after many trips to the rawing board, Boeing Astronautics' breadwinner design broke all the barriers of fighter designs, with it's sleek, compact body and shortened 'wings', making it /the/ most manueverable craft in the Stellar Force.</P>

<P>Blindingly fast, and hard to hit, the Hellfire is capable of peppering it's target with a storm of plasma fire, and departing before the shots even hit.  The new design allows the thrusters to exceed the maximum rated speed of even the joint-ventured D-110 Hornet.  The D-120 is the fighter of choice for space stations and singular support craft (such as the CF series).  The Hellfire is a tough little ship, able to take as much damage as the B-224, and perhaps more.</P>

<P>The standard armament of the D-120 is four AFPC-IIs, two of which are mounted on the edges of either wing, while the other two are situated along the fuselage.  Rumor has it the inner cannons will output at 120% power, due to the extra support from the fuselage when discharged, however, there has been no documentation to this effect.  Production on the D-120 began in 2095 by Boeing Astronautics.</P>

<P><H3>The D-125 (Nicknamed: Wraith)</H3></P>

<P>Stellar Dynamics, Inc's counterdesign on Boeing's D-120, resulted in the production of the heavy fighter D-125, with the same rated speed and firepower, but lacks in it's ability to dogfight capably, although testing showed it to stalemate the D-110 and D-120 on occasion.</P>

<P>Sleek, black, with longer wingspan and heavier firepower, the aptly named Wraith can acheive the D-120's maximum rated speed, but a bit more longer than the Hellfire can.  The weak spot of the D-125 can be found in it's armor, during fast flight.  Two direct hits from a fully charged AFPC-II, or one hit from the projected AFPC-III will disable the craft's propulsion.</P>

<P>The standard armament of the D-125 is two AFPC-IIs, mounted on the fuselage, facing forward.  The wingmounts can carry up to ten long-range concussion torpedoes, or five mini MW torpedoes, making the Wraith a dangerous capital ship killer.  The Wraith began production in 2097, by Stellar Dynamics, Inc.</P>

<P><H3>The D-127</H3></P>

<P>Classified, the contract belongs to Lockheed-McDonnell-Douglas, and will be released for production in late 2098.  The conjectural nickname for this craft is the "Hammerhead".</P>

<P><H3>The D-133</H3></P>

<P>Classified, but rumored to be Boeing Astronautics crown acheivement, from the buzz during the last Council Military Appropriations Committee meeting, the proposed 'sequel' to the D-120 Hellfire.  Conjectural nickname for this craft is the "Shadow".</P>
