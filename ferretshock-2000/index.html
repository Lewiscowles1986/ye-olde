					<h2>8.15.00 : Got a kidney? Get a pulse rifle.</h2>
					<p>Yes, kids, that's right. if you've got a spare kidney, you can afford to buy props from James Cameron's classic Aliens. It's all pretty simple, really. Brazillian newspapers report that Hector is trying to sell one of his kidneys for $10,000 on the open market. While officials scramble to explain why this is Not Really Legal and Should Never Be Done, he's making good on biological redundancy.</p>
					<p>So where do props from Aliens come in? Ferretshock bets you kissed your Colonial Space Marine fantasies goodbye long ago, didn't you? Well, friend, we're here to tell you: it's safe to dream again. Bob Smith of Nevada was lucky enough to snag a passel of props when production of the movie finished up, and he's got them on the open marketc. The price of the choice items (body armor and a pulse rifle worn by Major Hicks) is... $10,000! Coincidence? I think not.</p>
					<p>Really, who needs a second kidney?</p>

					<h2>8.14.00 : NGE + DVD = WHEE</h2>
					<p>It's got big robots, lots of explosions, and a plot so intricately woven that people still argue about What The Hell It Was Really All About. What more can you want from anime? Not much, that's what ferretshock says. We finally got our paws on the Ep. 1-4 DVD, and it's scrummy. [story continues]</td>
