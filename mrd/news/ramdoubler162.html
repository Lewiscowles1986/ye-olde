<p>We strongly suggest System 7.5 users install System 7.5 Update 2.0, which addresses several performance and compatibility issues with the Mac OS.

<p>Because of the increased system requirements of System 7.5, 8MB of RAM is required for RAM Doubler (and recommended by Apple for System 7.5).

<p>NOTE: With System 7.5.2 or later, the Memory control panel always reports that virtual memory "will be off after restart" when RAM Doubler is installed (RAM Doubler does not load if virtual memory is on).
<p>
<h3>KNOWN COMPATIBILITY ISSUES</h3>

<p>Hewlett Packard (HP) DeskWriter print drivers may exhibit slow performance or failure under extended memory (i.e. while running with either RAM Doubler or Apple virtual memory).  
<MENU>
	<LI>Workarounds: according to HP technical support, use one of the following: 1) turn off the "Background Printing" option (located in the Chooser when selecting DeskWriter); or 2) reduce the amount of free memory before printing by opening several applications so that the "Largest Unused Block" reported by the Finder is smaller (we recommend trying to lower it to below 1500K if you are experiencing this problem).
	<LI>Solutions: according to HP, DeskJet 800 series and DeskWriter 600 series owners should use the HP QuickDraw Printer Driver version 8.x, which is compatible with extended memory (available at <A HREF="http://www.hp.com:80/cposupport/indexes/deskwrit.html">http://www.hp.com:80/cposupport/indexes/deskwrit.html</A>; America Online - Keyword = HP; CompuServe = Go HP). If you are using any other DeskWriter model, contact HP regarding the release schedule for an extended memory compatible driver for your DeskWriter model.
</MENU>

<p>AppleTalk Users: Make sure you have the latest AppleTalk driver; older versions of AppleTalk have compatibility issues under extended memory (virtual memory or RAM Doubler). Open the Network control panel to check the version of AppleTalk listed. If there is no version listed or the version listed is less than 58.1.5, then AppleTalk should be updated using Network Software Installer 1.5.1, available from most Apple software sites online or from an Apple Dealer. Note: Open Transport has no known compatibility issues with extended memory.

<p>Accelerators that do not support Apple's Virtual Memory are not compatible with RAM Doubler.  These accelerators which lack a MMU (Memory Management Unit) include: 
<UL>
	<LI>Radius Rocket
	<LI>Fusion Data System's TokaMac
	<LI>Mobius Speedster 040
	<LI>Applied Engineering Transwarp
	<LI>MicroMac Carrera
</UL>
<p>Similarly, non-accelerator hardware add-ons that are not compatible with Apple virtual memory may have problems with RAM Doubler as well; all third-party PowerBook display cards, notably the Envisio display adapters, are not compatible with RAM Doubler.

<p>Retrospect 3.0 users should use System 7.5.3. Additionally, Retrospect 3.0 users should contact Dantz to upgrade to version 3.0A. An updater is available at <A HREF="http://www.dantz.com">http://www.dantz.com</A>.

<p>Some hard disk drivers, notably early versions of Alysis' eDisk, allocate memory in a way that prevents RAM Doubler from extending RAM.  Contact your hard drive vendor if you receive the alert concerning a driver not in the system heap.

<p>Apple Internet Connection Kit users should upgrade to version 1.1 for compatibility with extended memory.

<p>GeoPort users should use version 2.3.3 or later of the GeoPort Telecom software.

<p>FreePPP users should upgrade to version 2.5 or later for compatibility with extended memory. FreePPP is available from <A HREF="http://www.rockstar.com">http://www.rockstar.com</A>.

<p>American Heritage Dictionary users should use version 3.6 or later.

<p>Apple DOS Compatibility Card users should use Apple CD-ROM version 5.0.4 or later for compatibility with Windows 95.

<p>usrEZ's UltraShield and UltraSecure users should update to version 3.52 (for UltraSecure) and 2.52 (for Ultra Shield), or later.

<p>NEC DPI on the Fly users should use version 3.0 or later.

<p>FWB SCSI JackHammer users should disable "use main memory as buffers" in the JackHammer control panel.

<p>The following items are not compatible with extended memory environments (more total memory than built-in memory); therefore, these items are not currently compatible with RAM Doubler or Apple virtual memory:  
<UL>
	<LI>Texas Instruments' Paper Tray Manager for microLaser printers
	<LI>"AV DSP Power" plug-in for Adobe Photoshop on the 660AV and 840AV
	<LI>Around the World in 80 Days CD-ROM
</UL>
<p>Note: This is not a complete listing of items that do not work with virtual memory, but contains the most common items reported. Anything that is not compatible with Apple virtual memory is not compatible with RAM Doubler.

<p>MacTCP 1.0 and 1.1 are not compatible with RAM Doubler; we suggest upgrading to version 2.0.4 or later which is compatible. As of this writing, MacTCP 2.0.6 is the current version.

<p>Macintosh 660AV or 840AV with System 7.1 users: make sure you have at least version 1.1 of the "Enabler 088" file.  Version 1.0 causes problems with the Express Modem when RAM Doubler is installed.  You can acquire Enabler 088 version 1.2 by installing System Update 3.0 (for System 7.1) from Apple; or, by upgrading to System 7.5, which has the latest enabler built-in.

<p>68030-based PowerBook and Duo users with 8 MB RAM in System 7.5, may experience the following if in 24 bit mode:
<OL>
	<LI>the PowerBook won't go to sleep when you shut the lid 
	<LI>the physical buttons for the monitor backlight don't work
	<LI>the floppy drive doesn't work
</OL>
<p>Solution:  Turn on 32 bit addressing in the Memory Control Panel or install System 7.5 Update 2.0 which fixes these problems in 24 bit mode.

<p>In general, you should use the latest System Update from Apple.  As of this writing, for System 7.5, it is System 7.5 Update 2.0; for System 7.1 it is System Update 3.0.
