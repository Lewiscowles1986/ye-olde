						<p>The Wastelands theme is low-tech. Period. The ruins of civilization are all around, but the understanding of twentieth and twenty-first century technology has faded away as those who knew how to make 'tech' died.</p>
						<p>Almost two centuries have passed since the war, and few people see the Old World as more than legend. Livestock and farming are more immediate concerns, and a good horse is more valuable than fanciful tales of things called 'cars.' With no power plants, electrical devices are mostly useless. Characters are *certainly* not going to be running around with laser weapons and night-vision goggles. For that matter, even guns, motors, and other complex machinery are extremely rare.</p>
						<p>Mechanical devices, like pulleys, winches, locks, crossbows for hunting, etc, are more common. Any machines that require mass-produced parts are rare and treated with great care; guns can be found, but bullets are almost unheard of. Those with mechanical aptitude and creative minds are rare but invaluable to a tribe -- they can often assist in repairing broken machines, or constructing new ones from scavenged parts.</p>
						<p>'Found' technology is relatively common, but not all of it is understood. An old solar calculator, grimy and battered from use, is a likely candidate. Unfortunately, only a handful would understand its usefulness -- the calculator's operation would be quite mysterious, since literacy is almost nonexistant. A mountain bike, found in the ruins of an old warehouse, might be one man's most valuable posession. Repairs would be time consuming and fussy, with no replacement parts available. A Bic lighter would be an amazingly useful find. Even after running out of lighter fluid, its flint would be useful for starting tinder.</p>
						<p>In general, if your character owns or discovers a piece of old tech, it's cool. Don't go overboard, and drop a line to one of the player staff or a game admin if you have questions about it. [see '<a href="guidelines.html">guidelines</a>' for more information]</td>
