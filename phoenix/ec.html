<P>After the Battle of Vulcan, in which the destruction of Hope Station by Admirals Andrews and MacEwen resulted in the phyrric victory for the Earth Confederation, the remnants of the old Stellar Military Forces were too fragmented to maintain. The years leading up to that battle had seen severe losses, and military cohesion was little more than a dream. After the deaths of the two remaining admirals, the structure literally collapsed. Some commanders attempted to maintain order in what forces they had, while others disbanded their forces to join up with various splinter governments and homestead worlds. Had the alien forces not halted their advances following the Second Battle of Hope, humanity would surely have perished.</P>

<P>The Earth Confederation survived -- at least, some say that it did. Others maintain that the EC is no longer, and the new 'Confederation' is simply a grasp at dying glory by those who crave the power others once held. Whether this is true or not holds little importance -- the EC, though far less powerful than the world government that bore the same name, is here once again.</P>

<P>In any case, soon after the reborn Earth Confederation began construction of Hope Station II, its leadership realized the necessity of a fully organized defense force to ensure the safety of those under its watchcare. Proposals by government thinktanks, in conjunction with junior officers of the former Stellar Military Branches, led to the formation of the Stellar Defence Force. The new organization consolidated the functions of all three branches under one command structure. The new, streamlined organization was designed to ensure that the cataclysmic blunder at the Battle of JaCen'S Folly would never happen again.</P>

<P>In 2132, with the near-completion of the new Hope Station, the Stellar Defense Force completed reclaiming and refitting the property of the defunct Stellar Fleet and Stellar Force branches. Totaling just over 200 spacecraft, a vast majority of them being small short-range fighters and shuttles, these ships now form the bulk of the SDF's military strength. It is estimated that an additional 20-50 ships from the old Stellar Fleet and Stellar Force are still in use across the system by private individuals and small splinter governments, though exact figures are impossible to obtain at present.</P>
