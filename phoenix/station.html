<P>Hope Station consists of seven 'decks,' stacked atop one another like the layers of a cake. Each layer is a functional entity, dedicated to a particular purpose. Military operations, Residential quarters and services, education and research, commerce, resource production, and the like. For more information, see Deck Layout, below.</P>

<P>Each deck is divided into four quadrants -- Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. Each quadrant -- or 'quad' -- is redundant and 'isolated' from the other three. All services, power sources, security systems and the like are present in each of the four quads. In the event of an attack, any quad can be immeadiately seald off from the other quads -- event vented to open space -- without affecting services on the others. In this way, 75% of any deck can be disabled without loss of critical functions. When deck isolation is taken into account, only 3.5% of the station's mass need be functional for life support and critical functions in that area to remain operational.</P>
