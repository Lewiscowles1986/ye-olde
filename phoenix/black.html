Though technology, providence and ingenuity have made survival possible for humanity's remaining souls, the impact of the changes and their affect on daily life is deeply felt. Items once taken for granted are all but nonexistant, transformed by rarity into commodities -- foodstuffs like coffee, real meat, dairy products, wine and chocolate; entertainment from Earth... Indeed, anything whose production draws resources away from more essential items is luxury.
</P>

<P>
It's been said, though, that nothing is impossible -- the thriving black market, whose robust network of links and ties helped humanity survive through the dreadful years of war, is now above ground. Whether it's information on the latest happenings on Jericho, a crate of handmade cigars from before the war, or a ride to the pirate-infested Hermes Asteroid, there are those who can help you get what you want...
</P>

<P>
Travellers must beware, though, of the ruffians who roam open space in search of easy prey. Like brothers parting when their mother has passed on, some of Earth's children have turned to darker ways, to the self-serving life of the pirate. Though their ties with the black market are impossible to ignore, few admit to cooperating with such individuals.
</P>

<P>
These worlds tie togeter in a precarious balance -- the once-black market, now grey, holding together strands of humanity far separated... the menace of piracy, an ever-present threat to most, and an uncertain ally to some... the last wisps of humanity, clinging to life and working to build a new future for all.
