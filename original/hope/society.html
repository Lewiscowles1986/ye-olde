<H1 ALIGN=LEFT>Society</H1>

<P>
        Most of Earth society has progressed beyond the normal day-to-day interpersonal activity to what was once know in the twentieth century as the Internet.  Abbreviated to the Net, the society interacts in virtual reality more often than in actual reality, with the exception of government officials and military officers.  Aboard the stations and colonies, however, only a
small percentage indulges in Net activity, most of the action is in space operations and studies, so there really isn't any time for virtual reality.

<P>
        The society of the Earth has forsaken any type of ethnic prejudice, the echos of the World Peace Convention still ringing in the ears of the citizens, with world unification and a sense of brother- and sisterhood.  The only holders of racist tendancies are those who still believe a cyborg is a lower form of life on Earth, meant to serve humans as lifelong slaves, regardless of the proof that cyborgs are human by their DNA.  SEE: Section Ten.

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Economy</H2>

<P>
	 The economy of the EC is based on Precious Metals and Resource Units.  Precious Metals, such as Gold and Silver, Resource Units, such as Power Generation.  The currency of the EC is called the Monetary Unit or MU, for short.  Slang term for the MU is a 'unit'.  Denomiations of the unit are a 'quarter', 'a half' or a 'one-two', and 'a three-four'.  Almost everyone has an account with the gigantic Unibank, and can complete transactions with a mere thumbprint.  Hard currency is still carried, but very rare.  Anyone who does not have a Unibank account is usually frowned upon and sometimes refused service (on Earth.  On Hope Station, refusal of service is as unusual as murder.. beggars can't be choosers ;).
