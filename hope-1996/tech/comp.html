<H2>Computer System</H2>

<P>
	The main computer system of Hope Station is the most important single operation element of the station, next to the crew.  The computer is responsible for 95% percent of the station's functions, from life support to the opening of doors.  
</P>

<P>
	The residents and crew of the station interface with the main computer by way of the operating system, Voice Activated Operating and Accessing System or VAOAS (pronounced 'vows').
</P>

<P>
	There are five computer cores, one primary and four secondary cores, spread out over the station's Docking and Residential Hubs, with the primary situated in the Operations Hub.  Core processor speeds are beyond the million megahertz range, clocked at a speed of three million megahertz.  Storage capacity of each core module exceeds seven thousand terabytes, with one thousand modules in each core.  All five computer cores act in concert with each other to provide maximum efficiency to the users.
</P>

<P>
	Every control panel on the station is linked to a subprocessor or direct into the network.  Each panel is continually scanned by VAOAS for keyboard or vocal input every four hundred nanoseconds.
</P>

<P>
	Personal data devices can link to the computer network through a low radio frequency (LRF) data-streaming network, allowing devices such as Scibers to talk to the network at ten terabytes per nanosecond.
</P>

<H2>Scribers</H2>

<P>
	A handheld device about the size of a clipboard, with a stylus apparatus to enter input by hand.  Many users still prefer to write or enter data on the scriber through the use of handwriting, mostly for letters and such, as most authors found the verbal input to be much easier.
</P>

<P>
	Scribers aboard Hope Station are instantly linked to the LRF network once the first communications link is established.  Through recent technology, the computer can track the movement of the scriber and even use the scriber as a locator device, if necessary.
</P>

<P>
	Scriber functions include mail, news gathering, tracking personal finances and transactions, and long-range instantaneous visual transmissions.  It is limited to one terabyte of local information storage.
</P>
	
<P>
	The larger cousin to the Scriber is the Terminal, which normally sits on a desktop or a station.  It performs the same functions as the scriber, but outdoes the Scriber in local data storage, holding five terabytes of information at a time.
</P>

<H2>Storage Devices</H2>

<P>
	Since the vocal input alone records information at over a megabyte per second, storage devices increased their capacity tenfold every year to accomodate the rise in systems.
</P>

<P>
	The floppy disk of the twentieth century gave way to a larger diskette-type device called the ZIP disk, which held ten times what the floppy held.  From then, the storage boom increased, with the JAZZ disk holding a gig of information.
</P>

<P>
	Currently, the standard form of information storage are the InfoWafers, which hold up to twenty terabytes of information, and are compact, half of size of a 20th centory floppy, at only an inch in width and two inches in length.
</P>

<P>
	They are made to be compatible with a Scriber and a Terminal, slipped in on the side of both devices and the data is available within a nanosecond.
