<P>
	After the advent of fusion power, a new type of power relay network came into use, with backups and redundancies all over the station.
</P>

<P>
	There are over fifty different fusion reactors powering Hope Station, half of them responsible for powering the long rotator 'cuff', which rotates the station to create a gravitational field.  The other half is entrusted with providing power to the station in the form of life support and other needed functions.
</P>

<P>
	Power relays are installed every five hundred meters of corridor, with a major junction point at every ten thousand.  The power relay network is set up for easy access from a panel, or a crawlspace somewhere inside the station.
