<H1>The Earth Confederation</H1>

<P>
<A NAME="history"></A>Established as the planetary 'nation' in 2090, the Earth Confederation was the byproduct of the the pacifistic Pacific Community's Proposal of 2089.  The governments of the world determined at the Stanford University World Peace Summit that the form of government would be that of a councillatory democracy.  Jacquelin Otonashi, of the Japanese Counselate, was voted by a two-thirds vote to be the first president of the Earth Confederation, with Michael Yuri Brown, the North American Technocratic Party Leader as her Vice-President.  The representatives for the Council were chosen to reflect large regional areas, rather than the old Economic Unions from earlier in the century.

<P>
<A NAME="organization"></A>The President and Vice-President were voted into five-year terms of office, while Council Members held office for only three.  The judicial system from the old United States was retained,  and a Consitution was drafted on August 25, 2090.  The capital of the Earth Confederation is located in San Francisco, North America.
