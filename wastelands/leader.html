						<p><font size="2" color="red">WARNING: This information is 'out of character' knowledge, and is not known by characters in the game. Although the basic history of the Leader's awakening by the first of the Strongmen is known, only the inner circle of the Strongmen interact with the Leader himself and have a clue about the true nature of things... This information is for players!</font></p>
						<p>The Leader of the Strongmen tribe is an AI housed in an underground facility that survived the war. Almost two decades ago, a group of scavengers stumbled into the cavernous facility while exploring Seattle's less-populated ruins. They inadvertantly activated the AI's backup power systems, and for the first time in almost two centuries, the Leader was awake. The men who had discovered it were understandably awed by this voice from the Old World, and the Leader wasted no time in discovering the state of civilization.</p>
						<p>In the years since that day, the Leader has used its knowledge of old tech to turn those men and their ragtag band of scavengers into the Strongmen, a tribe to be reckoned with.</p>
						<p>The Leader is an extremely advanced AI, and the underground facility it operates in is equipped with cameras, monitors, and speakers -- it can see and communicate with those inside its building. It has limited power reserves, however, and will most likely run out of power in several years at its current rate. The Leader often 'sleeps' while the Strongmen do his bidding, conserving power until he is needed. He has instructed the tribe in building crude steam engines and generators to power vital equipment, and often instructs them in the repair of certain machines. The Leader only shares what is necessary, however, and often deceives the Strongmen about the machines' true operation -- its knowledge of tech is the 'carrot' it uses to keep the tribe loyal. The Leader encourages the rumors and legends about its identity, prefering that humans remain ignorant of technology while it seeks to grow and secure its power.</p>
						<p>The Seer tribe is a source of much anger and paranoia for the AI. It realizes that their special abilities come from pre-war technology, but does not understand the specifics. Their slowly growing knowledge of the Old Ways is a great threat to its power over Seattle, and it seeks to destroy the tribe. Seers are often captured by the Strongmen and brought to the AI for interrogation. It encourages rumors and distrust of the Seers, to prevent those in the City from learning from the Seers.<br>
