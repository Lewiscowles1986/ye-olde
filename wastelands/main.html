					<td>The Wastelands roleplaying theme is a post-war world of the distant future. After a cataclysmic war in the twenty-first century, humanity nearly destoys itself. Tectonic weapons unleash earthquakes of untold power, and neutron bombs leave entire cities dead. In the centuries that follow, the few survivors struggle for their lives. Now, almost one hundred and fifty years later, knowledge of the old world is lost, and what technology remains is little understood.
						<p>In the ruins of once-proud Seattle, center of the lost century's technology boom, neighborhoods are little more than crumbled skyscrapers and overrun buildings. Thousands still live in its limits, protected from roving bands by the Strongmen. Gifted with technology by their unseen Leader, the Strongmen enjoy the benefits of power, crude weapons, and medicines. Their little-understood machines, repaired by the Leaders' hand, give them power; though their numbers are small, they hold the power of life and death for those in the city.</p>
						<p>Another tribe makes its home in the mountains, ruthlessly hunted by the Strongmen and mistrusted by most in the city. Called seers by outsiders, this close-knit group knows little of tech and rarely ventures into the dangers of the city. Gossips whisper that the seers have no need for words; their thoughts are shared by the entire tribe, and they live with one mind...</p>
						<p>Now, both struggle for survival in the harsh world humanity has created.</p>
						<p><img height="36" width="366" src="titles/fast_facts.gif"></p>
						<p>* There are two tribes, the Seers and the Strongmen. See the Tribes page for more information.</p>
						<p>* The ruins of Seattle may seem deserted by day, but thousands still live there, lurking in abandoned buindings and in old tunnels beneath the surface.</p>
						<p>* Common activities for tribe members include hunting for food, guarding supplies, repairing simple machines, scouting, caring for children, etc...</p>
						<p>* Common dangers include wild animals, mutant animals from the eastern deserts, and nomadic raiders who steal resources and take slaves. Volcanic activity isn't unheard of, and 3.0-5.0 earthquakes are relatively comon.</td>
