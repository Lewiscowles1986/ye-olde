						<p>What does Wastelands need? General tribe members, for one. For the Seers, herders, mechanics, and scouts are in demand. For the Strongmen, scouts, hunters, and other roles are sought. Folks interested in controlling puppets for roleplaying adventures (bears, visiting merchants, nomadic raiders from the west, giant mutated desert scorpions, etc.) are also needed.</p>
						<p>If you've got an idea, drop us a line!</p>
						<p>If you're interested in serving as a tribal leader, or an assistant to a tribal leader, contact the current staff and/or Lament. Wastelands player-staff (IE, tribal leaders for the Seers and Strongmen groups) are responsible for the day to day 'happenings' in the theme. Type '+staff' while connected to see the names of the current tribal leadership.</p>
						<p>ICly, a tribal leader's role is obvious; to guide and command the tribe. OOCly, a tribal leader is the person who makes sure things run smoothly and that people aren't 'falling through the cracks.' If you have an idea for a cool TP that would involve both tribes, or lots of people in your own tribe, drop a line to the tribal leader, or the leader's assistant.</p>
						<p>Tribal leaders are only in place for two months of 'real time' -- if they're doing a good job and want to keep doing it, then they'll probably continue. If they want to take a break or someone else is in line, an IC event will be created to allow the 'passing of the torch.' It might be an IC challenge to their leadership, an injury that puts the current leader out of commission for a while, or simply the changing tides of IC politics.</td>
